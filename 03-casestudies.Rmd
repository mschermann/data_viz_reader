1. Connecting the Dots Behind the Election

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/17/us/elections/2016-presidential-campaigns-staff-connections-clinton-bush-cruz-paul-rubio-walker.html?_r=1

This article by the New York Times lists several different candidates and creates compelling visuals that link their campaigns to previous ones.

Each visual contains several different-sized dots that represent a specific campaign, administration, or other governmental organization related to the candidate’s current campaign, which are then connected by arrows.

Hovering over a specific dot highlights the connections between the groups. The visual is a great way to put what would otherwise be a long slog through years of information into an easily accessible, easily viewable format so that voters can figure out where the candidates’ experiences lie.


2. Spies in the Skies

The map is filled with red and blue lines (representing FBI and DHS aircraft, respectively) which illustrate the flight paths of the planes. When planes circle an area more than once, the circles become darker. The circles change in accordance to day and time, and individual cities can be typed into a search bar to see the flight patterns over them.

The visualization, rather creatively, almost looks like a hand-drawn map. While presenting a normally uncomfortable topic, this allows individuals to check things for themselves, hopefully providing some peace of mind.


3. Green Honey

The visualization spans a webpage. As you scroll down, the text changes, as do many colored dots that move over the white background. The dots are used to represent not only each colors’ hue, but the numbers that fall into each category—for example, what colors are the most popular “base” colors for English and Chinese.

The continuous flow of this visualization helps really bring it together, allowing users to scroll through the information at their own pace, but also creating a seamless, creative work.

4. How People Like You Spend Their Time

The visual lists several categories along one side of a graph—such as “personal care” and “work”—with a line illustrating the amount of time the average person in a certain demographic spends on each subject. Entering different statistics at the top—such as changing gender or age—causes the lines to shift to feature that demographic.

The simplicity of this visualization really helps the information get across and avoids bogging down the statistics. Sometimes, less is more.

5. Is it Better to Rent or Buy?

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0

The calculator includes several sloping charts. Each chart includes a factor that’ll affect how much you’ll have to pay, such as the individual cost of your home and your mortgage rates. A movable scale along the bottom of each chart allows you to enter different data, changing the “cost of rent per month” on the side. If you can find a similar house to rent for that much per month or less, it’s more cost effective to just rent the home.

This visualization is incredibly thorough and a useful tool for homeowners of any age and status.


## Deceptive data graphs examples

references: **Misleading Graphs: Real Life Examples http://www.statisticshowto.com/misleading-graphs/**

Misleading graphs are sometimes deliberately misleading and sometimes it’s just a case of people not understanding the data behind the graph they create. But some real life misleading graphs go above and beyond the classic types. Some are intended to mislead, others are intended to shock. The “classic” types of misleading graphs include cases where:

+ **The Missing Baseline.**

For example, the Vertical scale is too big or too small, or skips numbers, or doesn’t start at zero, like the graph below:

![](http://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/misleading-graph-2.jpg)

You might be thinking that the graph on the right shows The Times makes double the sales of The Daily Telegraph. But take a closer look at the scale and you’ll see although The Times does make more sales, it’s only beating the competition by about 10%.


+ **The graph isn’t labeled properly.**

Graghs can have the correct figures, but still can mislead you. 

![](http://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/usa-today-1.png)

This one used a BIG HEADLINE makes you think that 5.3% of children get spinal cord injuries which is a pretty scary statistic for parents. But the real figure is about .0000003% (based on 2000 injuries per year out of a population of around 74,000,000).

And for the figure 1 used in this article: Misleading Graphs: Displaying a Change in One Variable Using Area or Volume https://www.forbes.com/sites/naomirobbins/2012/02/28/misleading-graphs-displaying-a-change-in-one-variable-using-area-or-volume/#696674551781, the label for the smaller triangle in this graph says $26.4 while the label for the larger triangle says $114.6.  $114.6 is 4.34 times $26.4. It certainly looks to me as if more than 4.34 smaller triangles will fit in the larger triangle. It is the altitudes of the triangles that are proportional to the numbers in the labels. 


+ **Data is left out.**

Only include part of the data like the following graph which using temperatures of the first half of the year to prove it was rising dramatically.
