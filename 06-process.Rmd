# How to run a data viz project


## How to structure a data visualization project
[@data_viz_idea]

### Bring big data visualization up front

Enterprises are finding ways to create data visualization front ends that can be explored by front-line workers.
Rather than have developers create a purpose-built app, enterprises can wire up Google's Data Studio to their data sources, then create and style a simple UI with Analytics Canvas.

###  Connect time and space

Marketers use location intelligence to understand consumer preferences, behavior or loyalty based on when, where and how often someone shows up. Customer support managers use location intelligence to create better customer experiences, since physical location is usually a big part of servicing a customer -- from predicting arrival, delivering timely solutions to urgent issues and routing. Business development teams use location intelligence to reduce risk for future investments, such as where to open a new store, where to drill a new well, or where to construct a new cell tower.

### Visualize the voice of the employee

Large organizations realize that employee turnover is a problem, but they struggle to shift to a more personalized and prescriptive engagement strategy. With a higher demand on skilled resources, increased attrition, and costly hiring and on-boarding processes, U.S. businesses are losing millions to tens of millions of dollars every year due to turnover.
Some employee experience elements that Acumen has built visualizations for include employee interaction analysis to visualize the drivers and satisfaction across multiple channels and workforce landscape analysis to understand workforce makeup and which types of employees are more or less loyal.

### Map data visualization to the real world

In general, visual analytics experts recommend focusing on simple charts and lines to make it easier to tease apart relationships between elements in big data. 
For example, a data visualization project on flight seat analysis for a major airline. Using seat booking data from millions of transactions, the team built a visualization shaped like an airplane with the exact seating arrangement as the actual aircraft. The seats that generated more revenue appeared darker in the visualization, helping the airline identify profitable seats that could bepriced  higher, along with the poorly occupied ones that needed promotions. These visualizations were interactive and could be analyzed across several parameters to get deeper insights.
