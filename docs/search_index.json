["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction ##Data Visualization Data visualization refers to representing data in a visual context, like a chart or a map, to help people understand the significance of that data. Making sense of facts, numbers, and measurements is a form of art â€“ the art of data visualization. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. https://eagereyes.org/ https://research.tableau.com/user/robert-kosara https://twitter.com/eagereyes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor http://flowingdata.com/ Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2018) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "]
