<th><strong>Criteria</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Balance</strong></td>
<td>A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color, shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed. Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualization distributed evenly. And it is important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc. that can affect the balance of the display.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Emphasis</strong></td>
<td>Draw viewers’ attention towards important data by using key visual elements. Emphasis is the component that is most related to when reading the nine principles of design. It is the key to be conscious of what is drawing the viewer’s attention to the art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Movement</strong></td>
<td>Ideally movement should mimic the way people usually read, starting at the top of the page, moving across it, and then down. Movement can also be created by using complementary colors to pull the user’s attention across the page or with use of animation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Pattern</strong></td>
<td>patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or for sets of data that equal in value. Disrupting the pattern can also be effective in drawing viewers’ attention; it naturally draws curiosity.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Repetition</strong></td>
<td>Relationships between sets of data can be communicated by repeating chart types, shapes, or colors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Proportion</strong></td>
<td>If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going to look bigger. In data visualization, the proportion can indicate the importance of datasets, along with the actual relationship between numbers. Proportion can be subtle, but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer’s experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally, images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization. Proportion can be misused intentionally as well as unintentionally, since images are easier to interpret than data by humans. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rhythm</strong></td>
<td>A design has proper rhythm when the design elements create the movement that is pleasing to the eye. If the design is not able to do so, rearranging visual elements may help.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Variety</strong></td>
<td>Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be overlooked. Variety, which could seem counter to balance, but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However, if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Unity</strong></td>
<td>Unity across design will happen naturally if all other design principles are implemented.</td>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Gestalt Principles of Design</h3>
<p>Data is simply a collection of many individual elements (i.e., observations, typically represented as rows in a data table). In data viz, our goal is usually to group these elements together in a meaningful way to highlight patterns and anomalies. Described this way, it makes sense that the following principles by Gestalt are a good set of guidelines to assemble different elements into groups <span class="citation">(FusionCharts <a href="#ref-principles-fusioncharts">2012</a>)</span>.</p>

<td><strong>Figure and ground</strong></td>
<td>We typically notice only one of several main visual aspects of a graph; what we do notice becomes the figure, and everything else becomes the “background”. This one is especially interesting because it is not as obvious as some of the others, but is really important in matching a data viz design to its purpose.</td>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3.1</span> Principle 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within reason</h4>
<p>Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. It is also the proportion of graphic’s ink devoted to the non-redundant display of data-information.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{Data \ Ink \ Ratio} = \frac{{Data \ Ink}}{{Total \ Ink}}\]</span></p>

When creating visualizaitons, information is best displayed by adhering to the data to pixel ratio rule. This rule states that a visulaization should contain as much data as possible while also using as little pixels as possible. Through a comprehensive editing and testing process, any visualization can continually be improved upon. The main stakeholder of any visualization is the audience and their ability to understand what the visualization is trying to get across. Although if an audience member is not able to understand the visualization, there is nothing lost, but for those that do understand it, something is gained. It is a great feat for an audience member to be able to understand a statistical graphic because it is the most frequently made mistake in underestimating an audience. New designs, although may appear odd, have not been seen before and can be successful visualizations. Therefore, visualizations that produce a lot of data with the space provided with detailed statistics and are able to be understood by a wide array of audiences are produced with a well put together revising and testing system.

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3.2</span> Principle 2: Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data.</h4>
<p>The danger of multifunctioning elements is that they tend to generate graphical puzzles, with encodings that can only be broken by their inventor. Thus design techniques for enhancing graphical clarity in the face of complexity must be developed along with multifunctioning elements. In other words, we should try to make all present graphical elements data encoding elements. We must make every graphical element effective (See the following example).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Best Practices</h2>
<p>Data visualization does not unleash a ready-made story on its own. There are no rules or protocols to guarantee a story. Instead, we need to look for <em>insights</em>, which can be artfully woven into stories in the hands of a good journalist <span class="citation">(Jonathan Gray and Chambers <a href="#ref-The-Data-Journalism-Handbook">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Here is a process for finding insights that tell a story. Each of these steps will be discussed further in this section.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Telling a Story with Insights.</h3>
<p>Storytelling is an essential component of data visualization. The visualization must communicate complex ideas with precision and efficiency. The presenter must understand their audience’s level of understanding and tailor their visualizations accordingly. An audience’s level of analysis is key to creating and presenting a compelling story. Stikeleather’s article outlined five key points to consider for telling a compelling story through a visualization<span class="citation">(Jim Stikeleather <a href="#ref-storytelling_with_data">2013</a>)</span>.</p>

<td><strong>5 Second Rule</strong></td>
<td>Research shows that the average modern attention span for viewing anything online is less than 5 seconds, so if you can’t grab attention within 5 minutes, you’ve likely lost your viewer. Include clear titles and instructions, and tell people succinctly what the visualization shows and how to interact with it.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Design and layout matter</strong></td>
<td>The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer. Artists use design principles as the foundation of any visual work.

<td><strong>Use color purposely and effectively</strong></td>

<div id="document-your-insights-and-steps" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Document Your Insights and Steps</h3>
<p>If you think of this process as a journey through the dataset, the documentation is your travel diary. It will tell you where you have traveled to, what you have seen there and how you made your decisions for your next steps. You can even start your documentation before taking your first look at the data.</p>
<p>In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset, we are already full of expectations and assumptions about the data. Usually, there is a reason why we are interested in that dataset that we are looking at. It’s a good idea to start the documentation by writing down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and reduces the risk of misinterpretation of the data by just finding what we originally wanted to find.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, the documentation is the most important step of the process, and it is also the one people most likely to skip. As you will see in the example below, the described process involves a lot of plotting and data wrangling. Looking at a set of 15 charts you created might be very confusing, especially after some time has passed. In fact, those charts are only valuable (to you or any other person you want to communicate your findings) if presented in the context in which they have been created.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.6</span> Adapt your story to a different set of audiences</h3>
<p>Jonathon Corum is a graphics designer for The New York Times and he provided a very informative talk to a strictly scientific audience on how to create and design visualizations that explain material originally created for a certain audience, i.e. the scientific community, but now is to be related to a different audience (in his case, the readership of the Times or maybe the public at large). The talk is filled with examples and breakdowns of how he has moved from his base content to the final product, all of which are illuminating examples by themselves. There is also great power in the broader themes that he is trying to convey.</p>
<p>Of course, it is easy to assume that we know the audience we are producing the work for, but even in this step, we should focus on the ultimate goal of conveying, understanding and explaining a concept.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.7</span> Developing Intuitive Dashboards</h3>

<td><strong>The dashboard should read left to right</strong></td>
<td>Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader’s eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important.

This should be kept in mind when designing a dashboard since dashboards are often used as a quick convenient way to look up data.</td>

<td><strong>Find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.</strong></td>
<td>Grouping unrelated data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the important thing is to tell a story not previously observed.

Grouping unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they change together.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Choose metrics based on why they matter</strong></td>
<td>Chosen metrics should be important and relevant to the current task. That doesn’t mean that each metric ought to be incorporated. You ought to be highly selective in determining which metrics earn a spot on your dashboard. Organization’s core objectives, availability of data that can shed light on the objectives, effectiveness of metric to explain contribution to the objectives etc. are some of the aspects to consider while choosing metrics. In short, every metric on your dashboard should connect to the organization objectives.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Keep it visual</strong></td>
<td>Dashboards are meant to be fast and easy to read. A well-designed, highly visual dashboard will be more widely adopted by audiences. Since metrics are also chosen in line with corporate objective, it will help in speeding peoples’ understanding. This will also help see the translation of individual department objectives into broader organizations objective.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Make it interactive</strong></td>
<td>Interactive, highly visual dashboards should enable audience to perform basic analytical tasks, such as filtering the views, drilling down, examining underlying data etc. Viewers should be able to get the big picture from the dashboard and then be able to drill down into a view that tells them the information they need to get their jobs done.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Keep it current or don’t bother</strong></td>
<td>Selected metrics should reflect current business challenges. You don’t need up-to-the-minute data. Data can be current quarterly, weekly, hourly, etc. as relevant to the timeline of the organization. Ability to change and update the metrics represented in the dashboard is an important aspect.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Make it simple to access and use</strong></td>
<td>Making dashboards easily accessible is critical. Web distribution is ideal for this - especially if dashboards can constantly pull current data and can adhere to IT protocols and security standards. Another alternative is posting files on websites, Wiki’s or blogs.</td>

<td><strong>Find the compelling narrative</strong></td>
<td>Along with giving an account of the facts and establishing the connections between them, don’t be boring. You are competing for the viewer’s time and attention, so make sure the narrative has a hook, momentum, or a captivating purpose. Finding the narrative structure will help you decide whether you actually have a story to tell. If you don’t, then perhaps this visualization should support exploratory data analysis (EDA) rather than convey information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Think about the audience</strong></td>
<td>If you think about data visualization as storytelling, then you realize you need to tailor your story to your audience; Novice: first exposure to the subject, but doesn’t want oversimplification; Generalist: aware of the topic, but looking for an overview understanding and major themes; Managerial: in-depth, actionable understanding of intricacies and interrelationships with access to detail; Expert: more exploration and discovery and less storytelling with great detail; Executive: only has time to glean the significance and conclusions of weighted probabilities. When you tell the right story to the right audience you are able to identify data points that resonate with the audience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Be objective and offer balance</strong></td>
<td>A visualization should be devoid of bias. Even if it is arguing to influence, it should be based upon what the data says–not what you want it to say. There are simple ways to encourage objectivity: labeling to avoid ambiguity, have graphic dimensions match data dimensions, using standardized units, and keeping design elements from compromising the data. Balance can come from alternative representations (multiple clustering’s; confidence intervals instead of lines; changing timelines; alternative color palettes and assignments; variable scaling) of the data in the same visualization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Don’t censor</strong></td>
<td>Don’t be selective about the data you include or exclude, unless you’re confident you’re giving your audience the best representation of what the data “says”. This selectivity includes using discrete values when the data is continuous; how you deal with missing, outlier and out of range values; arbitrary temporal ranges; capped values, volumes, ranges, and intervals. Viewers will eventually figure that out and lose trust in the visualization (and any others you might produce).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Edit, Edit, Edit</strong></td>
<td>Take care to really try to explain the data, not just decorate it. Don’t fall into “it looks cool” trap, when it might not be the best way explain the data. As journalists and writers know, if you are spending more time editing and improving your visualization than creating it, you are probably doing something right.</td>

&gt; “A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.” -Stephen Few</p>
<p>Dashboards display aggregated information visually and understandably. They give a comprehensive overview of a company, business department, process or project concerning achieving specific objectives, that are measured by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Also, they provide easy and immediate access to actionable analytics that can affect the bottom line of an entity.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages associated with dashboards are
1)They are customizable
2) They are interactive
3) They allow for Real-Time monitoring
4) All of the data is in one place
5) They are intuitive
6) They get everyone on the same page
7) They are capable of gaining viewers focus</p>
<p>Below is an example of a dashboard for a logistics of a transportation industry. When it comes to logistics, every moment matters, and maximum deliveries are expected to be on time.
This transportation dashboard makes it easy with delivery status, fleet efficiency, average loading time and other logistics KPIs.

<td><strong>Matplotlib</strong></td>
<td>Because matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library, many other libraries are built on top of it or designed to work in tandem with it during analysis. While matplotlib is good for getting a sense of the data, it’s not very useful for creating publication-quality charts quickly and easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Seaborn</strong></td>
<td>Seaborn harnesses the power of matplotlib to create beautiful charts in a few lines of code. The key difference is Seaborn’s default styles and color palettes, which are designed to be more aesthetically pleasing and modern. Since Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib, you’ll need to know matplotlib to tweak Seaborn’s defaults.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Ggplot</strong></td>
<td>ggplot is based on ggplot2, an R plotting system, and concepts from The Grammar of Graphics. ggplot operates differently than matplotlib: it lets you layer components to create a complete plot. For instance, you can start with axes, then add points, then a line, a trendline, etc. Although The Grammar of Graphics has been praised as an “intuitive” method for plotting, seasoned matplotlib users might need time to adjust to this new mindset.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Bokeh</strong></td>
<td>Like ggplot, Bokeh is based on The Grammar of Graphics, but unlike ggplot, it’s native to Python, not ported over from R. Its strength lies in the ability to create interactive, web-ready plots, which can easily give the output as JSON objects, HTML documents, or interactive web applications. Bokeh also supports streaming and real-time data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Pygal</strong></td>
<td>Like Bokeh and Plotly, pygal offers interactive plots that can be embedded in the web browser. Its prime differentiator is the ability to output charts as SVGs. As long as you’re working with smaller datasets, SVGs will do you just fine. But if you’re making charts with hundreds of thousands of data points, they’ll have trouble rendering and SVG will become sluggish.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Plotly</strong></td>
<td>You might know Plotly as an online platform for data visualization, but did you also know you can access its capabilities from a Python notebook? Like Bokeh, Plotly’s forte is making interactive plots, but it offers some charts you won’t find in most libraries, like contour plots, dendograms, and 3D charts.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Geoplotlib</strong></td>
<td>geoplotlib is a toolbox for creating maps and plotting geographical data. You can use it to create a variety of map-types, like choropleths, heatmaps, and dot density maps. You must have Pyglet (an object-oriented programming interface) installed to use geoplotlib. Nonetheless, since most Python data visualization libraries don’t offer maps, it’s nice to have a library dedicated solely to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Gleam</strong></td>
<td>Gleam is inspired by R’s Shiny package. It allows you to turn analyses into interactive web apps using only Python scripts, so you don’t have to know any other languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Gleam works with any Python data visualization library. Once you’ve created a plot, you can build fields on top of it so that users can filter and sort data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Missingno</strong></td>
<td>Dealing with missing data is a pain. Missingno allows you to quickly gauge the completeness of a dataset with a visual summary, instead of trudging through a table. You can filter and sort data based on completion or spot correlations with a heatmap or a dendrogram.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Leather</strong></td>
<td>Leather’s creator, Christopher Groskopf, puts it best: “Leather is the Python charting library for those who need charts now and don’t care if they’re perfect.” It’s designed to work with all data types and produces charts as SVGs, so you can scale them without losing image quality. Since this library is relatively new, some of the documentation is still in progress. The charts you can make are pretty basic but that’s the intention.</td>

<p>Data visualization is also used across many different industries. One popular area right now is healthcare, especially involving big data. The benefits and uses of interactive data viz are detailed in a paper from the University of Maryland (2013). <span class="citation">(Schneiderman <a href="#ref-data_viz_healthcare">2013</a>)</span></p>
<p><strong>The paper highlights three types of data that can and should be visualized to help in decision-making: personal, clinical, and public health information.</strong> Examples include: exploration of prescription patterns of different drugs and tracking personal health and fitness statistics. (Even the nice, clean Fitbit app home screen is a comprehensive dashboard!) Importantly, making sense of all this data collected from individuals will help healthcare organizations and companies provide more personalized and effective health treatment.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> How visualization impacts Industry/business</h3>
<p><span class="citation">(Lazarevich <a href="#ref-biz_strategy">2018</a><a href="#ref-biz_strategy">b</a>)</span> According to an Experian report, 95% of U.S. organizations say that they use data to power business opportunities, and another 84 percent believe data is an integral part of forming a business strategy. Visualization helps data impact business in following ways:</p>
<div id="cleaning" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2.1</span> Cleaning</h4>
<p>The simplest way to explain the importance of visualization is to look at visualization as a means of making sense of data. Even the most basic, widely-used data visualization tools that combine simple pie charts and bar graphs help people comprehend large amounts of information fast and easily, compared to paper reports and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare quality assets to derive valuable insights. Data cleansing is typically done by using instance reduction techniques.</p>
<p>Instance reduction: It helps to reduce the size of the data set without compromising the quality of insights that can be extracted from the data. It removes instances and generates new ones to make the data set compact. There are two major instance reduction algorithms:</p>
<p>Instance selection: It is used to identify the best examples from a very large dataset with many instances in order to curate them as the input for the analytics system. It aims to select a subset of the data that can act as a replacement for the original dataset while completely fulfilling the goal. It will also remove redundant instances and noise.</p>
<p>Instance generation: It involves replacing the original data with artificially generated data in order to fill regions in the domain of an issue with no representative examples in the master data. A common approach is to relabel examples that appear to belong to wrong class labels. Instance generation thus makes the data clean and ready for the analysis algorithm.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2.2</span> Extraction</h4>
<p>Known versatile tools for data visualization and analytics like Elastic Stack, Tableau, Highcharts, and more complex database solutions like Hadoop, Amazon AWS,and Teradata, have wide applications in business, from monitoring performance to improving customer experience on mobile tools. The new generation of data visualization based on AR and VR technology, however, provides formerly unfeasible advantages in terms of identifying patterns and drawing insights from various data streams.</p>
<p>Building 3D data visualization spaces, companies can create an intuitive environment that helps data scientists grasp and analyze more data streams at the same time, observe data points from multiple dimensions, identify previously unavailable dependencies and manipulate data by naturally moving objects, zooming, and focusing on more granulated areas. Moreover, these tools allow us to expand the capabilities of data visualization by creating collaborative 3D environments for teams. As a result, new technology helps extract more valuable insights from the same volume of data.</p>
<p>Data has shown phenomenal growth over the past decade and its widespread application by businesses as a growth catalyst continues to deliver positive results. The scale of data is massive and the volume, velocity, and variety of data call for more efficient processing to make it machine-ready. Although there is a multitude of ways to extract data such as public APIs, custom web scraping services, internal data sources, etc., there would always remain the need to do some pre-processing to make the data perfectly suitable for business applications. <strong>Data pre-processing techniques that play a key role in the process are :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data cleansing</li>
<li>Data Manipulation</li>
<li>Data normalization</li>
<li>Data Transformation</li>
<li>Missing values imputation</li>
<li>Noise identification</li>
<li>Minimizing the pre-processing tasks</li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2.3</span> Strategizing</h4>
<p>As the amount of data grows, it becomes harder to catch up with it. Therefore, data strategy becomes the necessary part of the success in applying data to businesses. Then how data visualization become an important tool in your strategic kit?</p>
<p>First, it helps you clean your data. Secondly, it allows you to identify and extract meaningful information from it. Finally, data visualization tools enable continuous real-time monitoring of how your strategy and now data-driven decisions influence performance and business outcomes. In other words, these tools visualize not only the data, but also the results, and help correct and optimize strategy on the go.</p>
<p>Data visualization is one of the initial and most important steps made to derive value from data. It determines how efficiently analysts can work with data assets, what insights they are able to extract and how their data strategy will develop over time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the quality and capabilities of data visualization directly influence how data impacts your business strategy and what benefits data applications can bring to the companies and their industries.</p>

<p>Corporate transparency, flat organizations, open book policies, etc. are terms executives and entrepreneurs learn about all the time <span class="citation">(Boost Labs <a href="#ref-SCORECARDS">2015</a>)</span>. As the corporate world shifts towards a more open culture, the demand for open data and insights have increased dramatically. This shift has helped the overall corporate strategic planning and management process easing the alignment of business activities towards a series of goals. Being transparent top down aligns the culture to sail towards the same North Star.</p>
<p>The growth of corporate transparency is not only important internally, but externally as well. Corporate certifications like B Corporations certifications (B Corp), require companies to provide a transparent view of their social conscious efforts to the general public.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Typography and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography">WIKI</a>)</p>
<p>The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters.</p>
<div id="preattentive-visual-attributes-and-typography" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2.1</span> Preattentive visual attributes and typography</h4>
<p>While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes, utilization of boldface, font variation, other typographic elements in data visualization are less prevalent.</p>
<p>Preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of how many items are displayed. Therefore, “preattentive visual attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and are virtually unaffected by load.” Examples of preattentive attributes are size/area, hue, and curvature.</p>
<p>This brings us to the disparate situation of the popularity of visual aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual attributes like size and hue. However, some typographic attributes such as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the two) are considered preattentive as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data visualizations by technological advances.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-typography-is-not-currently-popular-in-data-visualizations" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2.2</span> Why typography is not currently popular in data visualizations</h4>
<p>The authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general, the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small group of people rather than all of the data visualization design community. It is more likely that the use of typographic elements in data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias if current visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not to fix what is not broken. However, the authors also point out that despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization, other spheres like cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope of the parameter space?</p>
</div>
<div id="tips-for-using-typographic-attributes-in-visualizations" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2.3</span> Tips for using typographic attributes in visualizations</h4>
<p>The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility and the ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>
<p>There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for data visualization in the article, not all of which we agree are made more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes, but the “Who Survived the Titanic” visualization’s use of typographic attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly, such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text replacement to indicate gender and the passengers’ names.</p>
<p><img src="images/TypographicTitanic.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div id="criticisms-of-typography" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2.4</span> Criticisms of typography</h4>
<p>The authors round out the article by addressing the most common criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being whether or not text should even be considered an element of data visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more investment of attention to understand.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that “this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type” that while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of higher-level patterns.</p>
<p>Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying lengths representations of passengers’ names and was corrected by only including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only vary so much.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3</span> Infographics vs. Data Visualizations</h3>
<p>Data visualization and infographics both present visual information to users. While their purposes may seem similar, they actually have different use cases. This article explains the differences between an infographic and a data visualization <span class="citation">(Pritchard <a href="#ref-VIZVSINFO">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="data-visualization-vs-infographics" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3.1</span> Data Visualization vs Infographics</h4>
<p>Data visualization usually involves the presentation of summary statistics using visual forms such as graphs, plots or charts; its goal is to provide clear and succinct information about your research. Data visualization also typically focuses on the two important aspects of data and design. However, design should actually depend on the data itself; for example, the type of chart used in a data visualization should be selected based on which one best displays the particular data set. Since visualizations are important in telling stories (such as trends), it should avoid adding extraneous and distracting details. Data visualizations should be self-explanatory, and users should be able to draw conclusions on their own.</p>
<p>An infographic on the other hand, is typically a combination of illustrations, facts, and text. Infographics might include some components characteristic of data visualization, but in general feature a less data-driven storytelling. While infographics are not grounded in data, like data visualizations, infographics convey several ideas simultaneously; and like data visualization, the design should be both visually appealing and should be based in the function of conveying the visual story.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, the interactivity of a visualization will not only improve functionality but also provide a solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.</p>
