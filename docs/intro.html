<p><strong>#Data Visualization</strong> Data visualization refers to representing data in a visual context to help people understand the significance of that data. A way so that information, numbers, and measurements makes sense is a form of art – the art of data visualization. Graphs do that for us.</p>

<p>The article , written by Chris Pittenturf, VP-Data &amp; Analytics, Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment, talks about what data visualization is and its importance to the businesses today. The article begins with a definition of data visualization in simple terms and goes on to explain how a good data visualization should be visually engaging to the reader. Chris goes on to explain the basic criterias that a data visualization should satisfy to be an effective visualization. These criterias and their brief meanings are as follows: 1. Informative: The visualization should be able to convey the information of the data to the reader 2. Efficient: The visualization should not be ambiguous. 3. Appealing: The visualization should be captivating and visually pleasing. 4. (Optional) Interactive and Predictive: The visualizations can contain variables and filters for the users to interact with the visualizations in order to predict results of different scenarios.</p>
<p>Chris goes on to give various day-to-day examples where visualization gives a better understanding of the data. One extremely simple example used by Chris is that of an energy bill. Chris states that as a consumer, when we receive an energy bill, we normally look at the graph in the bill first before proceeding to read the text in the bill. Chris states that consumers are more likely to analyze and understand the visualizations before reading further along. The article ends with Chris emphasizing the importance of data visualizations in our businesses as well as in our daily lives. According to me, the article gives a simple, short and crisp understanding of what data visualization is and how it is relevant to everyone. It shows that data visualization is an aid to get a better understanding of the complex insights that any business data provides. Most of the data used by the businesses is highly unstructured and these businesses can get a better understanding of their businesses by visualizing their data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/information-visualization-a-brief-introduction" class="uri">https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/information-visualization-a-brief-introduction</a> This article is a brief introduction to Information Visualization. It explains briefly how information visualization helps to make sense of data, how it helps to find relationships between data and confirm ideas.</p>
<p>About David McCandless’s TED talk on data visualization: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization" class="uri">https://www.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization</a></p>
<p>Visuals help us understand concepts that would otherwise be difficult to contextualize—for example, expenditures or valuations of extremely large amounts of money are represented in the billion dollar-o-gram by color-coded, relatively-sized boxes. Furthermore, it allows synthesis of a breadth of information to be delivered in a small, easily-digestible, aesthetically pleasing way. Visuals serve as a sort of map for a vast landscape of information—they direct your eyes to the important places and details. And the eye, as McCandless notes, is uniquely suited among our senses to process large amounts of information and detect patterns.</p>
<p>The billion dollar-o-gram is extremely readable and rather pretty, but it seems a bit dubious to compare the predicted Iraq War cost to the “mushroomed” actual cost of Iraq and Afghanistan wars, since its purpose seems only to conflate two wars for dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Beyond its ability to make information from several different sources and in large amounts more quickly and easily understood, data visualization can also reveal smaller interesting patterns—allowing us to play the “data detective” as McCandless calls it. In other words, as we have already discussed, data visualization can not only be extremely effective in a declarative manner, but can also be used as an exploratory tool.</p>
<p>McCandless also postulates that we all have a latent “design literacy” that is being developed every day as we are constantly bombarded with visuals, and that our minds and our eyes are taking in this information and processing it so that we all have an intuitive sense of design, and have actually begun to demand a visual aspect to our information. This is an interesting perspective, since everyone does seem to have a sense of visual aspects—space, color, etc., but of course the time-honored adage tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So while it might be whimsical to claim that we are all designers, there is still, of course, great value in learning formal principles of design.<br />

<p>Besides of tableau, there are also several other software can use for data visualization. like Sisense, Plotly, FusionCharts, Highcharts, Datawrapper, Qlikview. This article is from forbes and have a briefly clear introduction about those 7 powerful software for data visualization. I think this could be helpful for me because for different purpose, I may need to create different graphs. There are several disadvantages of using tableau, a little explore of other 6 softwares may help me in the future if I’m seeking for substitutes of tableau.</p>

<p><strong>Practitioners Guide to Best Practices in Data Visualization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong> Jeffrey D. Camm, Michael J. Fry, Jeffrey Shaffer (2017) A Practitioner’s Guide to Best Practices in Data Visualization.Interfaces 47(6):473-488. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/inte.2017.0916" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1287/inte.2017.0916</a></p>
<p>These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and then focus your visualization with respect to those questions.</p>
<p>Brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways – unconscious (System 1 represents uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 – represents controlled function such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System -1 which has can have quick and correct impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows: -</p>
<p>** 1. Design and layout matter <strong> The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer. </strong> 2. Avoid Clutter <strong> Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio – the ratio of ink required to convey the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That means, avoid ink which do not add any information. </strong> 3. Use color purposely and effectively ** Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists in conveying your message. The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above principles.And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theoretical background of data visualization
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/intuitive-dashboard-design" class="uri">https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/intuitive-dashboard-design</a> Three rules to follow in order to develop intuitive dashboards:</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the dashboard should read left to right</li>
<li>group related information together</li>
<li>find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead to effective presentation of the data.</p>
<p>Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader’s eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important. Annual data is usually more important to a business but daily or weekly data could be used more often for day to day work. This should be kept in mind when designing a dashboard as dashboards are often used as a quick convenient way to look up data.</p>
<p>Grouping related data together is an intuitive way to help the flow of the visual. It does not make sense for a user to have to search in different areas to find the information they need.</p>
<p>Grouping unrelated data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the important thing is to tell a story not previously observed. Data analytics is all about finding stories the data is trying to tell. Once they are discovered, the stories need to be presented in an effective manner. Grouping unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they change together.</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretical background of data visualization</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Fundamental Components of Design</p>
<p>Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and unity as the design foundation of any work. If you want to take your data visualization from an everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the 9 principles of design from graphic designer Melissa Anderson’s article: <a href="https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/07/26/data-visualization-and-the-9-fundamental-design-principles/" class="uri">https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/07/26/data-visualization-and-the-9-fundamental-design-principles/</a></p>
<p>Balance doesn’t mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualiaztion distributed evenly. And it important to remember the non-data elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc., that can affect the balance of the display.</p>
<p>Another closely related component to balance is variety which could seem counter to balance, but when done correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.</p>
<p>Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to enhancing a viewer’s experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.</p>
<p>Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through the nine principles of design in this article. From prior experience with art through photography I understand it is key to be concious of what I am drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.</p></li>

<p>It is common to think of statistical graphics and data visualization as relatively modern developments in statistics. In fact, the graphic representation of quantitative information has deep roots.These roots reach into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depiction, and later into thematic cartography, statistics and statistical graphics, medicine, and other fields.</p>
<p>Developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical theory and practice, and empirical observation and<br />
recording, enabled the wider use of graphics and new advances in form and content.</p>

<li>Milestones Tour</li>
</ol>
<p>2.1 Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams</p>
<pre><code>  The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of stars and other
  celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration. </code></pre>
<p>2.2 1600-1699: Measurement and theory</p>
<pre><code>  Among the most important problems of the 17th century were those concerned with physical measurement— of time,
  distance,and space— for astronomy, surveying, map making, navigation and territorial expansion. This century also
  saw great new growth in theory and the dawnof practical application.</code></pre>
<p>2.3 1700-1799: New graphic forms</p>
<pre><code>  With some rudiments of statistical theory, data of interest and importance, and the idea of graphic representation
  at least somewhat established, the 18th century witnessed the expansion of these aspects to new domains and new
  graphic forms. </code></pre>
<p>2.4 1800-1850: Beginnings of modern graphics</p>
<pre><code>  With the fertilization provided by the previous innovations of design and technique, the first half of the 19th
  century witnessed explosive growth in statistical graphics and thematic mapping, at a rate which would not be
  equalled until modern times.</code></pre>
<p>2.5 1850–1900: The Golden Age of statistical graphics</p>
<pre><code>  By the mid-1800s, all the conditions for the rapid growth of visualization had been established— a “perfect storm”
  for data graphics. Official state statistical offices were established throughout Europe, in recognition of the
  growing importance of numerical information for social planning,industrialization, commerce, and transportation. 

   2.5.1 Escaping flatland
   2.5.2 Graphical innovations
   2.5.3 Galton’s contributions
   2.5.4 Statistical Atlases</code></pre>
<p>2.6 1900-1950: The modern dark ages</p>
<pre><code>  If the late 1800s were the “golden age” of statistical graphics and thematic cartography, the early 1900s can be
  called the “modern dark ages” of visualization. There were few graphical innovations, and, by the mid-1930s, the
  enthusiasm for visualization which characterized the late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of quantification
  and formal, often statistical, models in the social sciences.</code></pre>
<p>2.7 1950–1975: Re-birth of data visualization</p>
<pre><code>  Still under the influence of the formal and numerical zeitgeist from the mid-1930s on, data visualization began to
  rise from dormancy in the mid 1960s. </code></pre>
<p>2.8 1975–present: High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualization</p>
<pre><code>  During the last quarter of the 20th century data visualization has blossomed into a mature, vibrant and multi
  disciplinary research area, as may be seen in this Handbook, and software tools for a wide range of visualization
  methods and data types are available for every desktop computer.</code></pre></li>

<p>With the development, studies and new tools applied in data visualization, more people understand it matters. But given its youth and interdisciplinary nature, research methods and training in the field of data visualization are still developing. So, we asked ourselves: what steps might help accelerate the development of the field? Based on a group brainstorm and discussion, this article shares some of the proposals of ongoing discussion and experiment with new approaches:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adapting the Publication and Review Process</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As the article states, “both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ reviews could serve as valuable guides”, so providing reviewer guidelines could be helpful for fledgling practitioners in the field.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Promoting Discussion and Accretion</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of research papers actively occurs at conferences, on social media, and within research groups. Much of this discussion is either ephemeral or non-public. So ongoing discussion might explicitly transition to the online forum.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Research Methods Training</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Developing a core curriculum for data visualization research might help both cases, guiding students and instructors alike. For example, recognizing that empirical methods were critical to multiple areas of computer science, Stanford CS faculty organized a new course on Designing Computer Science Experiments(<a href="http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/" class="uri">http://sing.stanford.edu/cs303-sp11/</a>). Also, online resources could be reinforced with a catalog of learning resources, ranging from tutorials and self-guided study to online courses. Useful examples include Jake Wobbrock’s Practical Statistics for HCI and Pierre Dragicevic’s resources for reforming statistical practice.</p></li>

<p>Pick the Right Chart Type!</p>
<p>Data divusalization is combining the art and science. As for the art, we can say there are no correct answers for doing the visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, how to making sense of facts, numbers and measurement for better understanding is still have a logical path to follow.</p>
<p>To determine which kind of chart is hard for those people new to data visulization. Most people learn it by refering some other people’s work without understanding the logic behind. So they don’t have the theory in their mind to make the judgement. Here , I will introduce some guidance to choose the charts.</p>
<p>When we about to choose the type of chart, we need to answer some questions. - How many features would you like to show in a chart? - how many data points do you want to display for each variable? - Will you display time serious data or among items or groups.</p>
<p>After answered this question, you shoul able to get a better imagenation of your ideal graph. The simple guidance for using different type of chart is line charts for tracking trends over time, bar charts to compare quantities, scatter plots for joint variation of two data items, bubble charts showing joint variation of three data items, and pie charts to compare parts of a whole.</p>
<p>Let’s review the most commonly used chart types and expalin what circumstance should better use typical chart and the pros and conts of each type of chart. Before introduce differnt types of charts, you can use the following website to familiar with different types of charts. <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/">The Data Visualisation Catalogue</a></p>
<p>## Type 1 Column Charts. This should be the most popular chart type. This chart is good to do comparison between different values when specific values are important. TBD</p>
<p>Still have hard time to choose? There are many resources on line can help you do the decision. For example, Dr. Andre Abela create a chart selection diagram that is helpful to pick the right chart depends on the data type.

<p>Misleading graphs: Misleading graphs or distorted graphs, are graphs created which skews the data, intentionally or unintentionally, resulting in a representation of incorrect conclusions. There are some ways in which distorted graphs can be created: 1. Improper scaling of y axis: This is one of the classic misleading graphs. Instead of scale starting from zero or a baseline, y axis is scaled conveniently to highlight the differences among bins. 2. Improper labelling of graphs: Lack of labels make the graph hard to interpret for the reader and lead to wrong conclusions. 3. Paired graphs on different scale: It is not a fair comparison if two elements are plotted side-by-side, on a different scale and compared. This makes one graph look better than the other, even when it is not. 4. Dual axis with different scales: If we are plotting two elements on the same graph with different scales, even if the axes are properly labeled, it is assumed that both axes are on the same scale. 5. Incomplete data: Short-term graphs are made to manipulate the trend, which will not be seen otherwise. Time-series data are cut intentionally to just show a trend within a particular period to create a more favorable visual impression.</p>

<p><strong>Definions of Date Deception and Graphic Integrity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong> (1) Pandey, A. V., Rall, K., Satterthwaite, M. L., Nov, O., &amp; Bertini, E. (2015). How deceptive are deceptive visualizations? An empirical analysis of common distortion techniques. In CHI 2015 - Proceedings of the 33rd Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Crossings (Vol. 2015-April, pp. 1469-1478). Association for Computing Machinery. DOI: 10.1145/2702123.2702608 (2) Tufte, E. R., and Graves-Morris, P. The visual display of quantitative information, vol. 2. Graphics press Cheshire, CT, 1983.</p>
<p>Data visualization becomes more and more pupular to communicate and support arguments nowdays. There are lots of great resources online to create and design amazing data products, in the same time, there are some poorly-designed misleading deceptive data visualizations.</p>
<p>So what does <strong>data deception</strong> mean? Data deception, defined by School of Law at the New York University, as “a graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message.”</p>
<p>In reality, decades ago, Edward Tufte already introduced the concept of graphical intergrity in his book and presented six principles of graphic integrity. Here are the principles from book:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities measured.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Show data variation, not design variation.</p></li>
<li><p>In time-series displays of money, deﬂated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>6.Graphics must not quote data out of context.</p>
