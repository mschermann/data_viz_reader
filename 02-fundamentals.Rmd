An example to back some of our theories on 'how to tell stories using data visualization' / 'exploratory data visualization'

DATA USA :     https://datausa.io

MIT Media Lab in collaboration with Deloitte has created a new visualization tool, that aggregates US government open source data from various sources and mines information to generate trends and stories about cities, jobs, industries etc. to the common man.

Just looking at any of the open data sources would give us an idea about the vastness (breadth and depth) of the available data. It is amazing to see how they have brought it all together on a single platform in a very easy to decipher format.

What caught my attention here is the categorization of Information on the website that enables the following - 

1.	Easy browsing of various categories of information available at a single glance
2.	Easy search on any topic of interest and get deeper information on each
3.	Logical construction of information using data and visuals under each category
4.	Comparative Analysis of cities
5.	Variety of exploratory visualizations to learn from 
6.	Most important - Stories that these data tell For e.g. Evolution of the American Worker, Poverty is bad for your health, Men still dominate in the highest paying industries, Opioid addiction damage and so many others. 

We think of a topic, and its possible it's there! 

Value add to students, organizations, governments etc.: Better understanding of your consumers, talent pool, jobs, climate, and what not, that just improves our decision-making ability manifold by spending just a few seconds on the website

And for this class, the best part is that the data is also available for download. So, we can easily download this data, replicate the visuals and try to redesign and tell our own stories with this data.

There are also other similar websites, that has some good visualizations on census data: https://www.census.gov/dataviz/ 
Do explore!
