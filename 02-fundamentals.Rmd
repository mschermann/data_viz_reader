  These are the best practices of data visualization. Anticipate in advance what kind of questions the viewers will ask and
  then focus your visualization with respect to those questions. 
  
  Brain processes stimuli from our environment to process what is important in 2 ways – unconscious (System 1 represents
  uncontrolled functions such as facial expressions, reactions) and conscious (System 2 – represents controlled function
  such as solving math problems). Data Visualization leverage attributes of System -1 which has can have quick and correct
  impact in a most efficient manner. The three best practices of data visualization are as follows: - 

** 1. Design and layout matter **
      The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey your message to the viewer.
** 2.	Avoid Clutter **
      Keep it simple. To implement this always keep into account the data-ink ratio – the ratio of ink required to convey
      the intended meaning to the total amount of ink used in the table or chart should be as close to 1 as possible. That
      means, avoid ink which do not add any information.
** 3.	Use color purposely and effectively **
      Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distractive too. Thus, color should be used only if it assists
      in conveying your message. 
      The above three principles are illustrated with the help of scenarios and examples which helps to comprehend the topic
      in more meaningful and practical way in the article. It also gives various advantages of using the above 
      principles.And the above best practices could be applied to all the 3 types of analytics: descriptive, predictive and 
      prescriptive.

    Three rules to follow in order to develop intuitive dashboards:
    
    1. the dashboard should read left to right
    2. group related information together
    3. find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display visuals together to show the relationship.
    
    Often a designer can become too concerned with coming up with a visual that is too intricate and overly complicated. A dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following these rules will lead to effective presentation of the data. 
    
    Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader's eyes will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most important. Annual data is usually more important to a business but daily or weekly data could be used more often for day to day work. This should be kept in mind when designing a dashboard as dashboards are often used as a quick convenient way to look up data.
    
    Grouping related data together is an intuitive way to help the flow of the visual. It does not make sense for a user to have to search in different areas to find the information they need.
    
    Grouping unrelated data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the important thing is to tell a story not previously observed. Data analytics is all about finding stories the data is trying to tell. Once they are discovered, the stories need to be presented in an effective manner. Grouping unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they change together.

    1.  Fundamental Components of Design
          
          Artists use balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm, variety, and 
          unity as the design foundation of any work. If you want to take your data visualization from an 
          everyday dashboard to a compelling data story, incorporate the 9 principles of design from graphic 
          designer Melissa Anderson's article:
                  https://www.idashboards.com/blog/2017/07/26/data-visualization-and-the-9-fundamental-design-principles/
  
          Balance doesn't mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry, but it is important to have the
          elements of the dashboard/visualiaztion distributed evenly. And it important to remember the non-data elements, such
          as a logo, title, caption, etc., that can affect the balance of the display. 
          
          Another closely related component to balance is variety which could seem counter to balance, but when done
          correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However if overdone, too much variety can feel
          cluttered and blur together the images and data in the mind of the viewer.
          
          Arguably the most critical of the components is proportion. Proportion can be subtle but it can go a long way to
          enhancing a viewer's experience and understanding of the data. The danger of proportion though is that it can be
          easy to deceive people subconsciously. Naturally images will have a greater impact on how our brains perceive the
          dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results
          and even if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take is to interpret the data based on
          the image. This is why it is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization and 
          remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.
          
          Emphasis was the component that I most related to when reading through the nine principles of design in this
          article. From prior experience with art through photography I understand it is key to be concious of what I am 
          drawing the viewers attention to in my art. When thinking about the art design of data visualization it is also very
          important to remain keen on the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either drawing the
          viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being distracted or drawn elsewhere.
