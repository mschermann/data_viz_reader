   The basic objective of data visualization is to provide an efficient graphical display for summarizing and reasoning about    quantitative information. And during the last decades, political science has accumulated a large corpus of various kinds      of data, which makes it gradually become a more quantitative scientific field and requires using quantitative information      in the analysis and reasoning. 

   Data visualization plays several important roles in it: 1) helps create informative illustrations of the data,                recapitulating large amount of quantitative information on a diagram; 2) helps formulate new or supporting existing            hypotheses from quantitative data; 3) guides a statistical analysis of data and checks its validity.

   Some useful visualization methods are: 1) _Statistical graphics and infographics_; 2) _Geographical information systems        (GIS)_; 3) _Graph visualization or network maps_; 4) _Data cartography_.

**Misrepresentation through Data Visualization**

While the ideal purpose of data visualization is to improve others' understanding of the data presented, visualization can also be used to mislead. Some of the main methods of doing so are omitting baselines, axis manipulation, omitting data, and going against graphing convention.

Omitting baselines is used to imply a greater difference between two categories, such as in poll results comparing political parties. Axis manipulation by increasing the highest value on the y-axis affects the visibility of a slope, making data with an otherwise visible trend appear flat. Omitting selected data points or narrowing the window of a graph is used to hide an overall trend, such as a graph of a stock only showing a current trend and hiding previous bubbles. Graphs can also be designed to subvert convention so that at first glance the graph is conveying the opposite message, for example, by using the reader's associations of colors and temperature to create a graph where hot is blue and cold is red.
