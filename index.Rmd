# Preface

This is a collaborative writing project as part of the course MSIS 2629 "Data Visualization" at [Santa Clara University](http://www.scu.edu). The purpose of the class reader is to collaboratively engage with and reflect on data visualizations, to establish a solid theoretical background, and to collect useful practices and showcases. More information on the background of this project is available in the [syllabus](https://mschermann.github.io/msis2629spring2019).

The following text explains how we organize ourselves.

## References
**EVERY** reference must be included in the `book.bib` file. This file uses the BibTeX notation (Learn how to use BibTeX [here](http://www.bibtex.org/Using/)). Most literature search engines allow you to export the reference information in BibTeX. For websites we use the following minimal notation (you may add further information - usually the more the better is a good strategy):

```
@misc{great_viz,
  author = {{A great visualizer}},
  year = {1982},
  title = {A ficticious web page title},
  howpublished = {\url{http://great_viz_org/}},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}

```
Particularly important is the `note` field. Websites change frequently, so links will break. If we do this correctly, `[@great_viz]` will produce [@great_viz].

## Images 

Images should not be loaded from external website because the links may change. Instead download a version of the image and create a reference that contains the link to the image. For example the following image is a deceptive visualization (the bars do start at zero).

![An Example of a deceptive visualization](images/halper_welfare.jpg)

Source: [@halper_2012] referenced in [@andale_2014]


The citation for the image looks like this.
```
@misc{halper_2012,
  author={Halper, Daniel},
  year={2012},
  title = {Over 100 Million Now Receiving Federal Welfare},
  url={https://www.weeklystandard.com/daniel-halper/over-100-million-now-receiving-federal-welfare},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
```
You have probably found this image through a different website that explains the visualization. For example the following website explains some problematic aspects of this visualization:

```
@misc{andale_2014,
  author={Andalde, Stephanie},
  year={2014},
  title = {Misleading Graphs: Real Life Examples},
  url={http://www.statisticshowto.com/misleading-graphs/},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
```
## Basic Guidelines
Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
 head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
 booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
