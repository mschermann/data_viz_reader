# Conclusion

Reflection, Key Learnings, Outlook

**Key Lessons Going Forward:**

* **Don’t try to be too cute.** Using all the fancy features of a visualization tool can lead to complex and confusing graphics. Just because you have a flashy hammer, it does not mean that everything is a nail. Don’t lose your purpose in your infatuation with a new tool or feature. Stick to good design principles, and keep it simple (as was mentioned in the discussion about Patterns).

* **Don’t provide more data than you need to tell your story.** Humans have a tendency to want to create visualizations with multi-drill downs, filters, and tables. This is fine for ad hoc analysis, but if we are presenting a visual with a single story or argument, we must make sure every piece of data included plays a meaningful part in the story.

* **Have more data to show what-ifs.** A great way to provide more information in a visualization is to use filters to provide what-if views. Having filters for different scenarios, options, and time slices provide the user a way to review and discover various perspectives on your data. Just make sure the user does not have to work too hard to get there and that they do not get lost in the data.

* **Deliver value in your visualization.** Many graphs may be aesthetically pleasing or exiting but deliver no value. A graph with good value should deliver important insights to aid decision-making or prompt an action. Keep in mind, the main objective of a visualization is to deliver value, and each design decision should help achieve this.
 
* **Understanding your audience is the most difficult and important part of developing a visualization.** Different audiences will feel differently about the same chart. So when we develop the argument from the data, we should keep our intended audience in mind.

* **Share what you have found.** A visualization can be an effective influencer if used in the correct way and at the correct time. 

* **Think as author / reader** When designing the graph, try to stand at the reader side, to check whether the graph is make sense or is there any misleading happening? as a reader, sometimes need stand at the author side, you need to detect is there any visualization deception in the graph, before making any conclusion, understand very details and information the graph provided, legend, caption, numbers, etc. 

* **Do Calculations** Represent the data accurately is necessary, but sometime the original data cannot strongly support your main thesis. Some extra calcuation based on the original dataset could make your idea more clearly.
