Reflection, Key Learnings, Outlook

**Key Lessons so far everyone must have learned or going forward need to learn is, that for a good Data Visualization:**

+ Don’t Be Too Cute
Trying to use all the software’s features can lead to complex and confusing graphics. If any person finds a new hammer the tendency is to look at everything like a nail, even if it is a screw. Key point: Don’t lose yourself in your tool or a new theory you discover. Keep to good design principles and keep it simple (as we earlier said when discussing about Patterns).

+Don’t provide More Data Then You Need
Don’t include more data in a visualization than needed to tell the story. There is often a tendency to provide a visualization with multi-drill downs, filters, and tables. This is fine if we are providing a way to do ad-hoc analysis, but if we have a visual telling a single story, we must make sure the data included helps move the story along without letting the view get lost.

+Have More Data to show What-Ifs
A great way to look at visualization is to use filters to provide what-if views. Having filters for different scenarios, various options and different time slices provide the user a way to review and discover various perspectives on your data. Just make sure the user does not have to work too hard to get there and that they do not get lost in the data.  Keep it simple.

+Share What You Have Found
A visualization can be an effective influencer if used in a correct way and at the correct time.
