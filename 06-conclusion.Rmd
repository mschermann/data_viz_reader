# Conclusion

Reflection, Key Learnings, Outlook

This would conclude the Data Visualization and as we see that learnt a lot in the field of data visualization. In the previous chapters, we have presented some important theoretical and practical ingredients involved in the design of visualization methods and applications. As we have seen, designing an efficient and effective data visualization application is a complex process. This process involves representing the data of interest, processing the data to extract relevant information for the problem at hand, designing a mapping of this information to a visual representation, rendering this representation, and combining all this functionality in an easy-to-use application. Visualization is a highly dynamic field. There are different tools available to provide ease into this field and reduce the complexity.

**Key Lessons Going Forward:**

* **Don’t try to be too cute.** Using all the fancy features of a visualization tool can lead to complex and confusing graphics. Just because you have a flashy hammer, it does not mean that everything is a nail. Don’t lose your purpose in your infatuation with a new tool or feature. Stick to good design principles, and keep it simple (as was mentioned in the discussion about Patterns).

* **Don’t provide more data than you need to tell your story.** Humans have a tendency to want to create visualizations with multi-drill downs, filters, and tables. This is fine for ad hoc analysis, but if we are presenting a visual with a single story or argument, we must make sure every piece of data included plays a meaningful part in the story.

* **Have more data to show what-ifs.** A great way to provide more information in a visualization is to use filters to provide what-if views. Having filters for different scenarios, options, and time slices provide the user a way to review and discover various perspectives on your data. Just make sure the user does not have to work too hard to get there and that they do not get lost in the data.

* **Deliver value in your visualization.** Many graphs may be aesthetically pleasing or exiting but deliver no value. A graph with good value should deliver important insights to aid decision-making or prompt an action. Keep in mind, the main objective of a visualization is to deliver value, and each design decision should help achieve this.
 
* **Understanding your audience is the most difficult and important part of developing a visualization.** Different audiences will feel differently about the same chart. So when we develop the argument from the data, we should keep our intended audience in mind.

* **Share what you have found.** A visualization can be an effective influencer if used in the correct way and at the correct time.
