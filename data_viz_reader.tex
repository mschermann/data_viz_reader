\chapter{Preface}\label{preface}

This is a collaborative writing project as part of the course MSIS 2629
``Data Visualization'' at \href{http://www.scu.edu}{Santa Clara
University}. The purpose of the class reader is to collaboratively
engage with and reflect on data visualizations, to establish a solid
theoretical background, and to collect useful practices and showcases.
More information on the background of this project is available in the
\href{https://mschermann.github.io/msis2629spring2019}{syllabus}.

The following text serves explains how we organize ourselves.

\section{References}\label{references}

\textbf{EVERY} references must be included in the \texttt{book.bib}
file. This file uses the BibTeX notation (Learn how to use BibTeX
\href{http://www.bibtex.org/Using/}{here}.). Most literature search
engines allow you to export the reference information in BibTeX. For
websites we use the following minimal notation (you may add further
information - usually the more the better is a good strategy):

\begin{verbatim}
@misc{great_viz,
  author = {{A great visualizer}},
  year = {1982},
  title = {A ficticious web page title},
  howpublished = {\url{http://great_viz_org/}},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
\end{verbatim}

Particularly important is the \texttt{note} field. Websites change
frequently, so links will break. If we do this correctly,
\texttt{{[}@great\_viz{]}} will produce (visualizer
\protect\hyperlink{ref-great_viz}{1982}).

\section{Images}\label{images}

Images should not be loaded from external website because the links may
change. Instead download a version of the image and create a reference
that contains the link to the image. For example the following image is
a deceptive visualization (the bars do start at zero).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/halper_welfare.jpg}
\caption{An Example of a deceptive visualization}
\end{figure}

Source: (Halper \protect\hyperlink{ref-halper_2012}{2012}) referenced in
(Andalde \protect\hyperlink{ref-andale_2014}{2014})

The citation for the image looks like this.

\begin{verbatim}
@misc{halper_2012,
  author={Halper, Daniel},
  year={2012},
  title = {Over 100 Million Now Receiving Federal Welfare},
  url={https://www.weeklystandard.com/daniel-halper/over-100-million-now-receiving-federal-welfare},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
\end{verbatim}

You have probably found this image through a different website that
explains the visualization. For example the following website explains
some problematic aspects of this visualization:

\begin{verbatim}
@misc{andale_2014,
  author={Andalde, Stephanie},
  year={2014},
  title = {Misleading Graphs: Real Life Examples},
  url={http://www.statisticshowto.com/misleading-graphs/},
  note = {Accessed: 2018-04-26}
}
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{table} environments, respectively.--\textgreater{}

in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and
\textbf{knitr} (Xie \protect\hyperlink{ref-xie2015}{2015}).

\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{What is Data Visualization?}\label{what-is-data-visualization}

\textbf{Data visualization} is a graphic representation that expresses
the significance of data. It reveals insights and patterns that are not
immediately visible in the raw data. It is an art through which
information, numbers, and measurements can be made more understandable.
According to (Friedman \protect\hyperlink{ref-viz}{2008}):

\begin{quote}
The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information
clearly and effectively through graphical means. It does not mean that
data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely
sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both
aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing
insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its
key-aspects more intuitively.
\end{quote}

The main goal of data visualization is to communicate information
clearly and effectively through graphical means. It doesn't mean that
data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely
sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both
aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing
insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its
key-aspects in a more intuitive way.

``Data is the new oil'' may be a cliche, but it is true. Like oil, data
in its raw, unrefined form is pretty worthless. To unlock its value,
data needs to be refined, analyzed and understood (Disney
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lawfraud}{2017}). More and more organizations are
seeing potential in their data connections, but how do you allow
non-experts to analyze data at scale and extract potentially complex
insights? One answer is through interactive graph visualization.

\textbf{Information visualization} is the art of representing data so
that it is easy to understand and manipulate, thus making the
information useful. Visualization can make sense of information by
helping to find relationships in the data and support (or disproving)
ideas about the data. ({\textbf{???}}) shares some examples and common
uses of information visualization, such as:

\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Why data visualization is such a powerful tool:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is intuitive presenting a graph as a node-link structure instantly
  makes sense, even to people who have never worked with graphs before.
\item
  It is fast because our brains are great at identifying patterns, but
  only when data is presented in a tangible format. Armed with
  visualization, we can spot trends and outliers very effectively.
\item
  It is flexible. The world is densely connected, so as long as there is
  an interesting relationship in your data somewhere, you will find
  value in graph visualization.
\item
  It is insightful. Exploring graph data interactively allows users to
  gain more in-depth knowledge, understand the context and ask more
  questions, compared to static visualization or raw data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Importance of Data
Visualization}\label{importance-of-data-visualization}

Pittenturf explains basic criteria that a data visualization should
satisfy to be effective (Pittenturf
\protect\hyperlink{ref-viz_importance}{2018}):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Criteria}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut

\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Informative\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The visualization should be able to convey the desired information from
the data to the reader.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Efficient\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The visualization should not be ambiguous.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Appealing\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The visualization should be captivating and visually pleasing.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Interactive and Predictive (Optional)\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The visualizations can contain variables and filters with which the
users may interact to predict results of different scenarios.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Pittenturf goes on to give various day-to-day examples where
visualization gives a better understanding of the data. One
straightforward example used by Pittenturf is that of an energy bill.
Pittenturf states that when we, as consumers, receive an energy bill, we
usually look at the graph in the bill first before proceeding to read
the text in the bill. Pittenturf states that consumers are more likely
to analyze and understand the visualizations before reading further
along. The article ends with Pittenturf emphasizing the importance of
data visualizations in our businesses as well as in our daily lives. It
gives a simple, short and crisp understanding of what data visualization
is and how it is relevant to everyone. Data visualization is an aid to
get a better understanding of the complex insights that any business
data provides. Most of the data used by the businesses are highly
unstructured, and these businesses can get a better understanding of
their businesses by visualizing their data.

Another early adopter of graph visualization techniques was the
financial services industry. Fraud detection is about finding unusual
connections between accounts, transactions, insurance policies, devices,
etc. There is great value in visualizing that data as a graph. Known
fraud detection is primarily automated with rule scoring and pattern
matching. Visualization lets you review edge-cases and outliers more
quickly. Speed is important because sometimes analysts only have seconds
to approve or deny a transaction. In those cases, visualizations are
simple, small and with limited interaction. To get a clear overview
quickly, analysts need effective layouts. Other functionalities, like
expanding and filtering help fraud analysts to see context on demand.

Three things are consistent across both graph visualization use cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  They involve highly connected data (apparently).
\item
  That highly connected data conceals risk insight.
\item
  That insight is needed to power quick and confident decision making.
\end{enumerate}

When connected data insight is critical, only interactive and robust
visualization tools are up to the task.

\subsection{Increased Value for Increasing Volume of
Data}\label{increased-value-for-increasing-volume-of-data}

The enormous volume of data available to companies, governments and
people today means there is a vast (and growing) need for data to be
presented so that it delivers value. From business decision making to
route navigation, data visualization provides a simple, user-friendly
approach to understanding data and making faster, better decisions.

In his article on the importance of data visualization to businesses,
Chris Pittenturf uses the example of an energy bill to explain the
impact of data visualization: \emph{before we even read the text of the
bill, we look at the graph first} (Pittenturf
\protect\hyperlink{ref-viz_importance}{2018}). This simple example
demonstrates that data visualization is in every part of our daily lives
and that we are more likely to analyze and understand the visualizations
before reading further along. Pittenturf further explains most data used
by businesses are highly unstructured, so visualization provides a
better understanding of the complex insights coming from this
information.

\subsection{Understanding Concepts that are Difficult to
Contextualize}\label{understanding-concepts-that-are-difficult-to-contextualize}

In his TED talk, David McCandless gives an example of how expenditures
or valuations of enormous amounts of money are represented in the
billion dollar-o-gram by color-coded, relatively-sized boxes. This
allows the synthesis of a breadth of information to deliver in a small,
easily-digestible and aesthetically pleasing way. Visuals serve as a
sort of map for a vast landscape of information---they direct reader's
eyes to the relevant places and details. Moreover, the eye, as
McCandless notes, is uniquely suited to our senses to process large
amounts of information and detect patterns (McCandless
\protect\hyperlink{ref-viz_ted}{2010}). (The billion dollar-o-gram is
exceptionally readable and rather pretty, but it seems a bit dubious to
compare the predicted Iraq War cost to the ``mushroomed'' actual cost of
Iraq and Afghanistan wars since its purpose seems only to conflate two
wars for dramatic effect.)

McCandless also postulates that we all have a latent ``design literacy''
that is being developed every day as we continuously bombard with
visuals, and that our minds and our eyes are taking in this information
and processing it so that we all have an intuitive sense of design, and
have actually begun to demand a visual aspect to our information. This
is an interesting perspective since everyone does seem to have a sense
of visual aspects of space, color, etc. Of course, the time-honored
adage tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so while it
might be whimsical to claim that we are all designers, there is still
great value in learning formal principles of design (McCandless
\protect\hyperlink{ref-viz_ted}{2010}).

In his article on the importance of data visualization to businesses,
\textbf{Chris Pittenturf} uses the example of an energy bill to explain
the impact of data visualization: \emph{before we even read the text of
the bill, we look at the graph first} (Pittenturf
\protect\hyperlink{ref-viz_importance}{2018}). This simple example
demonstrates that data visualization is in every part of our daily lives
and that we are more likely to analyze and understand the visualizations
before reading further along. Pittenturf further explains most data used
by businesses are highly unstructured, so visualization provides a
better understanding of the complex insights coming from this
information.

\subsection{Revealing Small and Interesting
Patterns}\label{revealing-small-and-interesting-patterns}

It can reveal interesting small patterns and make you a ``data
detective.'' Beyond its ability to make information from several
different sources and in large amounts easily understandable, data
visualization can also reveal smaller interesting patterns, allowing us
to play the ``data detective'' as McCandless calls it. In other words,
as we have already discussed, data visualization can not only be handy
in a declarative manner but can also be used as an exploratory tool
(McCandless \protect\hyperlink{ref-viz_ted}{2010}).

\subsection{Easier Decision-making in
Healthcare}\label{easier-decision-making-in-healthcare}

Today, data visualization solutions can be found everywhere in
healthcare systems from hospital operations monitoring and patient
profiling to demand projection and capacity planning (Healthcare
\protect\hyperlink{ref-marksman}{2017}). Healthcare service providers
are increasing their efforts to investigate different visual and
interactive methods in creating and examining large graphs, charts,
interactive visualizations, and 2D/3D visualization of discrete event
simulation (DES) to comprehend complex and large datasets, recognize
connections and trends, model and simulate healthcare events, and
communicate and interpret the findings. Expected results include more
efficient and effective clinical performance monitoring and improvement,
patient flow modeling and management, better patient care quality,
security and effectiveness, better support for clinical costing and
resource coordination, better-planned development and competitive
advantage.

Traditional visualization strategies often require significant
processing time, which restrains high-throughput analysis. Interactive
visualization frameworks maintain a closed loop between the user and the
system and, thus, need to be very fast. Building such a framework
requires the development of new visualization methods, and there exists
the need to design new and useful interaction techniques which are being
developed by researchers.

Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside
\href{https://www.i2b2.org}{\textbf{i2b2}}, an initiative sponsored by
the NIH Roadmap National Centers for Biomedical Computing is another
such program that provides a query tool that supplies aggregate counts
and fundamental analyses of patient populations from clinical data
warehouses (CDWs). i2b2 (i2b2 to
\href{https://www.tableau.com}{\textbf{Tableau}}) is useful in
estimating patient cohort sizes and has an extendable design where
modules with additional features can be developed. Other tools such as
\href{https://www.r-project.org}{\textbf{R}} and
\href{https://www.python.org}{\textbf{Python}} are also helping
healthcare a lot. Health informatics databases and networks have
amplified benefits with information visualization as it dramatically
expands the capacity of patients, clinicians, and public health
policymakers to make better decisions.

\subsection{Law Enforcement and Fraud
Detection}\label{law-enforcement-and-fraud-detection}

The police have been using graph visualization, or link analysis as it
is commonly known for decades to join the dots in investigations. What
has changed is the use of technology to make joining the dots a more
automated and scalable process. A failure to analyze the bigger,
joined-up picture was cited as a shortcoming of the intelligence
services after the 9/11 terror attacks. In the years that followed, law
enforcement and security agencies drove graph visualization forward. New
approaches and technologies were explicitly created for large-scale data
analysis of communications records, open source intelligence (OSINT),
and police databases.

Lawful interception, the legally mandated interception of personal
communications data, provided vast volumes of data on criminal and
terrorist activity. Paired with social network analysis, graph
visualization techniques allowed non-specialized staff to explore the
data and uncover important insight.

\subsection{Design and Data Literacy}\label{design-and-data-literacy}

McCandless postulates that we all have a latent ``design literacy'' that
is being developed every day as we are constantly bombarded with
visuals, and that our minds and our eyes are taking in this information
and processing it so that we all have an intuitive sense of design, and
have actually begun to demand a visual aspect to our information. This
is an interesting perspective, since everyone does seem to have a sense
of visual aspects like space, color, etc. Of course, the time-honored
adage tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so while it
might be whimsical to claim that we are all designers, there is still
great value in learning formal principles of design (McCandless

\subsubsection{Data Visualization: A Modern
Product?}\label{data-visualization-a-modern-product}

Given the recent explosion in data availability and visualization tools,
it would be natural to assume that statistical graphics and data
visualizations are relatively modern developments. However, the graphic
representation of quantitative information has deep roots that reach
into the histories of the earliest map-making and visual depictions, and
up to thematic cartography, statistics, medicine, and other fields.

Developments in technologies (printing, reproduction) mathematical
theory and practice, and empirical observation and recording, and those
developments enabled the broader use of graphics and new advances in
form and content. This paper provides an overview of the intellectual
history of data visualization from medieval to modern times, as well as
describes and illustrates some significant advances along the way
(Friendly \protect\hyperlink{ref-data_viz_history}{2006}).

Data visualization has come a long way. Before the 17th century, data
visualization already existed. Though displayed in other formats such as
maps, the content is much similar to today's visualizations, which
mostly presented geologic, economic, and medical data. The earliest
seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the
positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps
to aid in navigation and exploration.\strut

\subsubsection{William Playfair
(1759--1823)}\label{william-playfair-17591823}

William Playfair is considered the father of statistical graphics,
having invented the line and bar chart are used so often today. He is
also credited with having created the area and pie chart. Playfair was a
Scottish engineer and political economist who published ``The Commercial
and Political Atlas'' in 1786. This book featured a variety of graphs
including the image below. In this famous example, he compares exports
from England with imports into England from Denmark and Norway from 1700
to 1780.

\subsubsection{John Snow (1813--1858)}\label{john-snow-18131858}

In 1854, a cholera epidemic spread quickly through Soho in London. The
Broad Street area had seen over 600 dead, and the surviving residents
and business owners had primarily fled the terrible disease. Physician
John Snow plotted the locations of cholera deaths on a map. The
surviving maps of his work show a method of tallying the death counts,
drawn as lines parallel to the street, at the appropriate addresses.
Snow's research revealed a pattern. He saw an evident concentration
around the water pump on Broad Street, which helped find the cause of
the infection.

\subsubsection{Charles Joseph Minard
(1781--1870)}\label{charles-joseph-minard-17811870}

Charles Joseph Minard was a French civil engineer famous for his
representation of numerical data on maps. His most famous work is the
map of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812 illustrating the dramatic
loss of his army over the advance on Moscow and the following retreat.
This classic lithograph dates back to 1869, displaying the number of men
in Napoleon's 1812 Russian army, their movements, and the temperatures
they encountered along their way. It has been called one of the ``best
statistical drawings ever created.'' The work is an essential reminder
that the fundamentals of data visualization lie in a nuanced
understanding of the many dimensions of data. Tools like D3.js and HTML
are no proper without a firm grasp of your dataset and sharp
communication skills. It represents the earliest beginning of data
journalism.

\subsubsection{Florence Nightingale
(1820--1910)}\label{florence-nightingale-18201910}

Florence Nightingale is famous for her work as a nurse during the
Crimean War, but she was also a data journalist. She realized soldiers
were dying from poor sanitation and malnutrition, so she kept meticulous
records of the death tolls in the hospitals and visualized the data. Her
coxcomb or rose diagrams helped her fight for better hospital conditions
and ultimately save lives.

Edmond Halley was an English astronomer, geophysicist, mathematician,
meteorologist, and physicist who is best known for computing the orbit
of Halley???s Comet. According to the BBC, Halley developed the use of
contour lines on maps to connect and describe areas that display
differences in atmospheric conditions from place to place. These lines
are now commonly used to describe meteorological variation common to us
from weather reports.

Charles de Fourcroy was a French mathematician and scholar. He produced
a visual analysis of the work of French civil engineers and a comparison
of the demographics of European cities.In 1782 he published Tableau
Poléometrique, a treatise on engineering and civil construction. His use
of geometric shapes predates the modern treemap, which is widely used
today to display hierarchical data.

Hans Rosling took his interest in global health and developed stunning
visualizations about it using statistical methods and data from the UN.
He was a noted TED speaker and one of his most interesting TED talks is
\emph{``Asia's Rise: How and When''} (Rosling
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hans}{2009}). In this video, Hans shows trends of
the Western countries vs.~Developing countries like India and China and
makes predictions using stunning visualizations like the Bubble chart.
He also predicts the exact date on which India and China will move ahead
of USA as strong economic forces.

Hans was the co-founder and developer of the Gapminder Foundation which
is committed to promoting global sustainable development through the
understanding of statistics and data describing issues at the local,
national, and global level (Ruan et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gapminder}{2017}). One of the most important
goals of the Gapminder foundation is to end ignorance in the world by
developing fact-based visualizations to present the world as it is (Ruan

\subsection{A cool website: MIT Media
Lab}\label{a-cool-website-mit-media-lab}

(Deloitte, Datawheel, and Hidalgo \protect\hyperlink{ref-DataUSA}{2016})
\href{https://www.media.mit.edu}{MIT Media Lab} in collaboration with
Deloitte has created a new visualization tool, that aggregates US
government open source data and mines information to generate trends and
stories about cities, jobs, industries, etc. Just looking at any of the
open data sources would give us an idea about the vastness (breadth and
depth) of the available data. It is impressive that they have brought it
all together on a single platform in a convenient format.

We think of a topic, and it is possible it is there! The benefits are a
better understanding of our consumers, talent pool, jobs, climate, which
helps improve our decision-making ability. The best part is that the
data is also available for download so we can replicate the visuals,
redesign and tell our own stories with this data. There are also other
similar websites, that has some good visualizations on census data:

\subsection{Standing out categorization of information on the
website.}\label{standing-out-categorization-of-information-on-the-website.}

What stands out is the categorization of information on the website
which enables the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Easy browsing of various categories of information available at a
  single glance
\item
  An easy search on any topic of interest and get more in-depth
  information
\item
  Logical construction of information using data and visuals under each
  category
\item
  Comparative analysis of cities
\item
  Variety of exploratory visualizations to learn from
\item
  Most important - Storytelling through data, such as the evolution of
  the American Worker, how poverty is bad for people's health, how men
  still dominate in the highest paying industries, and opioid addiction
  damage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automatic visualization vs.~context-specific
visualization}\label{automatic-visualization-vs.context-specific-visualization}

Automatic visualization is a bad idea, generally speaking. Some parts of
visualization indeed should be automatic, such as standard chart types
and recurring geometries. Pieces of visualization, such as annotation
and axis construction can be automatic.

However, full-on automation where insight fountains out from any dataset
is farfetched at this point because this requires automatic analysis.
Analytics is usually context-specific and requires more than boilerplate
statistics. The most interesting visualizations are
context-specific.(Flowingdata \protect\hyperlink{ref-auto_viz}{2017})

\subsection{Data analytics software}\label{data-analytics-software}

Data analytics software can analyze vast amounts of data and incredible
speeds, but how can it explain the results of that analysis? Today, the
only means of doing this is with graphics. Data visualization still
leaves room for interpretation. However, technology is catching up.
Narrative generation software can run as a plug-in to the dashboards.
Tools like Savvy install on a server and allow every dashboard user to
get a written summary of demand. This software is fully plugged and
play, it takes seconds to install, and it is easy to use. It runs with
Microsoft Excel, Qlik Sense 3.0, and is available as an API. It is an
example of how automation is making our working lives more comfortable
by automating repetitive tasks and allowing us to leverage existing data
reserves fully.(Manning \protect\hyperlink{ref-work_place}{2016})

\subsection{Data visualization can't explain data, leaving room for
interpretation.}\label{data-visualization-cant-explain-data-leaving-room-for-interpretation.}

According to Alysson Ferreira, a UI Engineer, there is an increasing
need to understand the latest trends quickly and efficiently, which
means there's also a need for significant sources of trustworthy
information.(Ferreira \protect\hyperlink{ref-UI_engineer}{2017})

This is where data visualization comes in. Data visualization is the art
of displaying information by combining the beauty of imagery with the
conciseness of statistics, which allows us to organize complex data into
useful graphical representations. In simple terms, data visualization is
the art of translating complex data into meaningful information.(Towler
\protect\hyperlink{ref-future_viz}{2015})

Plug in any data set into a magic box and it spits out a beautiful
visualization you can show all of your co-workers, friends, and family.
That is the promise of many startups, but it does not quite work that
way. The problem is that graphics alone don't fully explain data, and so
we are inundated with queries: why did the numbers fall in whatever
month? Data visualization cannot explain data, leaving room for
interpretation.

Although simple visualizations such as standard chart types (bar chart,
line chart, etc.) are already automated to a certain extent in Microsoft
Office tools and other software available in the market, full on
automation where insight fountains out from any data set are far-fetched
at this point because this requires automated analysis. The automated
analysis here means that the tool or algorithm has to understand the
context and also select the best visualization.

\subsection{One great tool: D3.js.}\label{one-great-tool-d3.js.}

The focus in today's world has been on open source tools and
technologies and these tools although being free for the most part to
require more effort to integrate to the current visualization workflow
seamlessly. As mentioned in one of the articles about D3.js:

D3.js is one of the first data visualization tools that comes to mind
when talking about free, open-source alternatives. It is a
JavaScript-based library for creating web visualization and displays the
results on the web page. However, with high power comes great
responsibility. \textbf{D3.js} is one of the first data visualization
tools that comes to mind when talking about free, open-source
alternatives. It is a JavaScript-based library for creating web
visualization and displays the results on the web page. However, with
high power comes great responsibility.

Ultimately, the focus should be on our goals rather than our tools.

\subsection{Infographics vs.~Data
Visualizations}\label{infographics-vs.data-visualizations}

Data visualization and infographics both present visual information to
users. While their purposes may seem similar, they have different use
cases. This article explains the differences between an infographic and
a data visualization. (Pritchard
\protect\hyperlink{ref-VIZVSINFO}{2016}).

\subsubsection{Data Visualization}\label{data-visualization}

Data visualization usually involves the presentation of summary
statistics using visual forms such as graphs, plots or charts; its goal
is to provide clear and succinct information about your research. Data
visualization also typically focuses on the two critical aspects of data
and design. However, a design should depend on the data itself; for
example, the type of chart used in a data visualization should be
selected based on which one best displays the particular data set. Since
visualizations are essential in telling stories (such as trends), it
should avoid adding extraneous and distracting details. Data
visualizations should be self-explanatory, and users should be able to
conclude on their own.

\subsubsection{Infographics}\label{infographics}

An infographic, on the other hand, is typically a combination of
illustrations, facts, and text. Infographics might include some
components characteristic of data visualization but in general feature
less data-driven storytelling. While infographics are not grounded in
data, like data visualizations, infographics convey several ideas
simultaneously; and like data visualization, the design should be both
visually appealing and should base in the function of conveying the
visual story.

cases, more often than not they can be used together. Some of the

\section{Design Principles}\label{design-principles}

\subsection{Melissa Anderson's Principles of
Design}\label{melissa-andersons-principles-of-design}

The following principles are from (Anderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-design_principles}{2017}).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Criteria}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Balance}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A design is said to be balanced if key visual elements such as color,
shape, texture, and negative space are uniformly distributed. Balance
doesn't mean that each side of the visualization needs perfect symmetry,
but it is important to have the elements of the dashboard/visualization
distributed evenly. And it is important to remember the non-data
elements, such as a logo, title, caption, etc. that can affect the
balance of the display.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Emphasis}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Draw viewers' attention towards important data by using key visual
elements. Emphasis is the component that is most related to when reading
the nine principles of design. It is the key to be conscious of what is
drawing the viewer's attention to the art. When thinking about the art
design of data visualization it is also very important to remain keen on
the main point of your story and how the entire visualization is either
drawing the viewer to that point of emphasis or how they are being
distracted or drawn elsewhere.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Movement}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Ideally movement should mimic the way people usually read, starting at
the top of the page, moving across it, and then down. Movement can also
be created by using complementary colors to pull the user's attention
across the page or with use of animation\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Pattern}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
patterns are ideal for displaying similar sets of information, or for
sets of data that equal in value. Disrupting the pattern can also be
effective in drawing viewers' attention; it naturally draws
curiosity.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Repetition}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Relationships between sets of data can be communicated by repeating
chart types, shapes, or colors.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Proportion}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
If a person is portrayed next to a house, the house is going to look
bigger. In data visualization, the proportion can indicate the
importance of datasets, along with the actual relationship between
numbers. Proportion can be subtle, but it can go a long way to enhancing
a viewer's experience and understanding of the data. The danger of
proportion though is that it can be easy to deceive people
subconsciously. Naturally, images will have a greater impact on how our
brains perceive the dashboard or visualization. For example, someone can
change the scale of a graph or images to inflate their results and even
if they write the numbers next to it, the shortcut many people will take
is to interpret the data based on the image. This is why it is important
we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data visualization
and remain critical of how others use proportion in their visualization.
Proportion can be misused intentionally as well as unintentionally,
since images are easier to interpret than data by humans. This is why it
is important we take care to accurately reflect proportion in our data
visualization and remain critical of how others use proportion in their
visualization.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Rhythm}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A design has proper rhythm when the design elements create the movement
that is pleasing to the eye. If the design is not able to do so,
rearranging visual elements may help.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Variety}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Variety in color, shape, and chart-type draws and keeps users engaged
with data. Including more variety can increase information retention by
the viewer. But when there is too much variety, important details can be
overlooked. Variety, which could seem counter to balance, but when done
correctly, variety can help increase the recall of information. However,
if overdone, too much variety can feel cluttered and blur together the
images and data in the mind of the viewer.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Unity}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Unity across design will happen naturally if all other design principles
are implemented.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Gestalt Principles of
Design}\label{gestalt-principles-of-design}

Data is simply a collection of many individual elements (i.e.,
observations, typically represented as rows in a data table). In data
viz, our goal is usually to group these elements together in a
meaningful way to highlight patterns and anomalies. Described this way,
it makes sense that the following principles by Gestalt are a good set
of guidelines to assemble different elements into groups (FusionCharts
\protect\hyperlink{ref-principles-fusioncharts}{2012}).

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut

\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
We typically notice only one of several main visual aspects of a graph;
what we do notice becomes the figure, and everything else becomes the
``background''. This one is especially interesting because it is not as
obvious as some of the others, but is really important in matching a
data viz design to its purpose.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Tufte's Principles of
Design}\label{tuftes-principles-of-design}

A graph should be impressive and can obtain audience's attention. How
can we achieve this? We must consider several aspects:
\textbf{efficiency, complexity, structure, density and beauty}. We also
should consider the audience whether they will be confused about the
design.

Before defining each principle, let us understand `Graphical integrity'
first.\textbf{Graphical integrity} refers to how accurately the visual
elements represent the data. The information can vary widely, even for
data that is related. So there is a desire and tendency to scale the
data disproportionately in order to make it fit in the space allowed.
When values are tightly packed in one area, and sparse in another, there
is a desire and tendency to spread things out evenly. In each case, this
can lead to a false impression of the data, and incorrect conclusions.
(Source:({\textbf{???}})(\url{https://study.com/academy/lesson/edward-tufte-6-principles-of-graphical-integrity.html}))

\subsubsection{Principle 1: Maximizing the data-ink ratio, within
reason}\label{principle-1-maximizing-the-data-ink-ratio-within-reason}

Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink
arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. It is also
the proportion of graphic's ink devoted to the non-redundant display of
data-information.

\[{Data \ Ink \ Ratio} = \frac{{Data \ Ink}}{{Total \ Ink}}\]

This basic idea is illustrated in the following visualizations.

\includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure1.png} (Source:(Tufte
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tufte_2001}{2001}))

\includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure2.png} (Source: (Plotly
\protect\hyperlink{ref-appli_2017}{2017}))

\includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure3.png} (Source: (Plotly
\protect\hyperlink{ref-appli_2017}{2017}))

\textbf{Always revise and edit}
\includegraphics{images/Tufte_figure4.png} (Source: (Tufte
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tufte_2001}{2001}))

The graphs will generally be better when more information is displayed
per unit of space and unit of ink. Graphics are almost always going to
improve as they go through editing, revision, and testing against
different design options. Try to figure out whether the audience looking
at the new designs will be confused. Nothing is lost to those puzzled by
the frame of dashes, and something is gained by those who do understand.

We can also assume that if you understand the statistical graphics, most
other readers will too, because it is a frequent mistake in thinking
about statistical graphics to underestimate the audience. Some of the
new designs may appear odd, but this is probably because we have not
seen them before.

\subsubsection{Principle 2: Mobilize every graphical element, perhaps
several times over, to show the
data.}\label{principle-2-mobilize-every-graphical-element-perhaps-several-times-over-to-show-the-data.}

The danger of multifunctioning elements is that they tend to generate
graphical puzzles, with encodings that can only be broken by their
inventor. Thus design techniques for enhancing graphical clarity in the
face of complexity must be developed along with multifunctioning
elements. In other words, we should try to make all present graphical
elements data encoding elements. We must make every graphical element
effective (See the following example).

\subsubsection{Principle 3: Maximize data density and the size of the
data matrix, within
reason.}\label{principle-3-maximize-data-density-and-the-size-of-the-data-matrix-within-reason.}

High preformation graphics should be designed with special care. As the
volume of data increases, data measures must shrink (smaller dots for
scatters, thinner lines for busy time-series).

\[{Data \ Density} = \frac{{Entries \ in \ the \ Data \ Matrix}}{{Area \ of \ Chart}}\]

\subsubsection{Principle 4: Escape flatland - small multiples, parallel
sequencing.}\label{principle-4-escape-flatland---small-multiples-parallel-sequencing.}

Data is multivariate doesn't necessarily mean 3D projection. How can we
enhance multivariate data on inherently 2D surfaces? We can use small
multiple graphs or parallel sequencing skill.

demand.}\label{principle-5-provide-the-user-with-an-overview-and-details-on-demand.}

A carefully designed view can show a macrostructure (overview) as well
as microstructure (detail) in one space.

  Graphics are almost always going to improve as they go through
  editing, revision, and testing against different design options.
\item
  Try to figure out whether the audience looking at the new designs be

  something is gained by those who do understand. We can also assume
  that if you understand the statistical graphics, most other readers
  will, too because it is a frequent mistake in thinking about
  statistical graphics to underestimate the audience.

\section{Best Practices}\label{best-practices}

Data visualization does not unleash a ready-made story on its own. There
are no rules or protocols to guarantee a story. Instead, we need to look
for \emph{insights}, which can be artfully woven into stories in the
hands of a good journalist ({\textbf{???}})(Anderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-design_principles}{2017})(``5 Data Visualization
Tips'' NA)(Jeffrey D. Camm
\protect\hyperlink{ref-practitioners_guide}{2017}).

Here is a process for finding insights that tell a story. Each of these
steps will be discussed further in this section.

\subsection{Determine the Story with
Insights}\label{determine-the-story-with-insights}

Storytelling is an essential part of data visualization. It is extremely
important to effectively communicate information through the
visualization. Stikeleather's article (Jim Stikeleather
\protect\hyperlink{ref-storytelling_with_data}{2013}) discussed the way
in which a visual designer tells a story with a visualization.

\subsection{How to choose the best form of
Visualization}\label{how-to-choose-the-best-form-of-visualization}

Since just loading data into a table format could be a form of
visualization, our focus should not be whether visualization is needed
but on which form of data visualization is best for the situation.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Focus}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{5 Second Rule}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Research shows that the average modern attention span for viewing
anything online is less than 5 seconds, so if you can't grab attention
within 5 minutes, you've likely lost your viewer. Include clear titles
and instructions, and tell people succinctly what the visualization
shows and how to interact with it.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Design and layout matter}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The design and layout should facilitate ease of understanding to convey
your message to the viewer. Artists use design principles as the
foundation of any visual work. If you want to take your data
visualization from an everyday dashboard to a compelling data story,
incorporate graphic designer Melissa Anderson's principles of design:
balance, emphasis, movement, pattern, repetition, proportion, rhythm,
variety, and unity, discussed in more detail in the design principles
section (Anderson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-design_principles}{2017}).\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Keep it simple}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Keep charts simple and easy to interpret. Instead of overloading
viewers' brains with lots of information, keep only necessary elements
in the chart and help the audience understand quickly what is going
on.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Pretty doesn't mean effective}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
There is a misconception that aesthetically pleasing visualization is
more effective. To draw attention, sometimes we want them to be pretty
and eye-catching. But if it fails to communicate the data properly,
you'll lose your audience's interest as quickly as you gained it.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Use color purposely and effectively}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Use of color may be prettier and attractive but can be distracting too.
Thus, the color should be used only if it assists in conveying your
message. Also another thing to keep in mind is to be consistent with the
color scheme that the organization/consumer is used to and also try and
follow the same color across dashboards while communicating a
story.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Analyze and Interpret}\label{analyze-and-interpret}

Once the data is visualized, the next step is to learn something from
the visualization that is created. Questions that can be asked based on
the picture can be:

\subsubsection{Macro/Micro-Provide the user with both views (overview
and detail)- (Tufte's Design Principle
2)}\label{macromicro-provide-the-user-with-both-views-overview-and-detail--tuftes-design-principle-2}

A carefully designed view can show a macro structure (overview) as well
as micro structure (detail) in one space.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What can be seen in this image? Is it what that was expected?
\item
  Are there any interesting patterns?
\item
  What does this mean in the context of the data?
\end{itemize}

Sometimes we might end up with visualization that, in spite of its
beauty, might seem to tell that nothing of interest can be found from
data. But there is almost always something that we can learn from any
visualization, however trivial.

\subsection{Document Your Insights and
Steps}\label{document-your-insights-and-steps}

If you think of this process as a journey through the dataset, the
documentation is your travel diary. It will tell you where you have
traveled to, what you have seen there and how you made your decisions
for your next steps. You can even start your documentation before taking
your first look at the data.

In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset, we
are already full of expectations and assumptions about the data.
Usually, there is a reason why we are interested in that dataset that we
are looking at. It's a good idea to start the documentation by writing
down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and
reduces the risk of misinterpretation of the data by just finding what
we originally wanted to find.

Personally speaking, the documentation is the most important step of the
process, and it is also the one people most likely to skip. As you will
see in the example below, the described process involves a lot of
plotting and data wrangling. Looking at a set of 15 charts you created
might be very confusing, especially after some time has passed. In fact,
those charts are only valuable (to you or any other person you want to
communicate your findings) if presented in the context in which they
have been created.

\subsection{Transform Data}\label{transform-data}

Naturally, with the insights that you have gathered from the last
visualization, you might have an idea of what you want to see next. You
might have found some interesting pattern in the dataset which you now
want to inspect in more detail. Possible transformations are the
following.

\textbf{Focusing the attention:} What can be removed? Realize that
consistency can help eliminate unnecessary distractions. There may be a
trade-off between losing information but conveying the ultimate meaning
more clearly. Label important things rather than relying on a legend,
which requires the viewer to hold on to too much information at once.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Transformation}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Zooming}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
This allows us to have look at a certain detail in the visualization
Aggregation To combine many data points into a single group\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Filtering}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
This helps us to (temporarily) remove data points that are not in our
major focus\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Outlier handling}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
This allows us to get rid of single points that are not representative
of 99\% of the dataset.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Let's consider the following example: You have visualized a graph and
what came out of this was nothing but a mess of nodes connected through
hundreds of edges (a very common result when visualizing so-called
densely connected networks), one common transformation step would be to
filter some of the edges. If, for instance, the edges represent money
flows from donor countries to recipient countries, we could remove all
flows below a certain amount (n.d.).

\subsection{Adapt your story to a different set of
audiences}\label{adapt-your-story-to-a-different-set-of-audiences}

Jonathon Corum is a graphics designer for The New York Times and he
provided a very informative talk to a strictly scientific audience on
how to create and design visualizations that explain material originally
created for a certain audience, i.e.~the scientific community, but now
is to be related to a different audience (in his case, the readership of
the Times or maybe the public at large). The talk is filled with
examples and breakdowns of how he has moved from his base content to the
final product, all of which are illuminating examples by themselves.
There is also great power in the broader themes that he is trying to
convey.

Of course, it is easy to assume that we know the audience we are
producing the work for, but even in this step, we should focus on the
ultimate goal of conveying, understanding and explaining a concept. Some
of the main highlights to help make this connection with the audience
involved are mentioned below:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Principle}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Involving your audience:}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Give them opportunities to connect their own general knowledge on the
topic. Use real world comparisons or examples to help build and relate
context. Encourage comparisons and make this easy for the viewer to
process and see.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Explaining why}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Providing context, adding time sequence details, showing movement,
change and mechanism will all guide your audience in connecting the dots
and understanding the significance of what you are trying to
communicate.\strut

\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Find the compelling narrative}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Along with giving an account of the facts and establishing the
connections between them, don't be boring. You are competing for the
viewer's time and attention, so make sure the narrative has a hook,
momentum, or a captivating purpose. Finding the narrative structure will
help you decide whether you actually have a story to tell. If you don't,
then perhaps this visualization should support exploratory data analysis
(EDA) rather than convey information.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Think about the audience}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
The visualization needs to be framed around the level of information the
audience already has, correct and incorrect: Novice: first exposure to
the subject, but doesn't want oversimplification; Generalist: aware of
the topic, but looking for an overview understanding and major themes;
Managerial: in-depth, actionable understanding of intricacies and
interrelationships with access to detail; Expert: more exploration and
discovery and less storytelling with great detail; Executive: only has
time to glean the significance and conclusions of weighted
probabilities.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Be objective and offer balance}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A visualization should be devoid of bias. Even if it is arguing to
influence, it should be based upon what the data says--not what you want
it to say. There are simple ways to encourage objectivity: labeling to
avoid ambiguity, have graphic dimensions match data dimensions, using
standardized units, and keeping design elements from compromising the
data. Balance can come from alternative representations (multiple
clustering's; confidence intervals instead of lines; changing timelines;
alternative color palettes and assignments; variable scaling) of the
data in the same visualization.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Don't censor}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Don't be selective about the data you include or exclude, unless you're
confident you're giving your audience the best representation of what
the data ``says''. This selectivity includes using discrete values when
the data is continuous; how you deal with missing, outlier and out of
range values; arbitrary temporal ranges; capped values, volumes, ranges,
and intervals. Viewers will eventually figure that out and lose trust in
the visualization (and any others you might produce).\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.19\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Edit, Edit, Edit}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Take care to really try to explain the data, not just decorate it. Don't
fall into ``it looks cool'' trap, when it might not be the best way
explain the data. As journalists and writers know, if you are spending
more time editing and improving your visualization than creating it, you
are probably doing something right.\strut

\subsection{Python for Data Visualization：10 Useful Python Data
Visualization
Libraries}\label{python-for-data-visualization10-useful-python-data-visualization-libraries}

({\textbf{???}})

The following table provides an overview of 10 interdisciplinary Python
data visualization libraries, from the well-known to the obscure.
\href{https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/}{Sample
charts for each}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Library}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Matplotlib}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Because matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library, many
other libraries are built on top of it or designed to work in tandem
with it during analysis. While matplotlib is good for getting a sense of
the data, it's not very useful for creating publication-quality charts
quickly and easily.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Seaborn}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Seaborn harnesses the power of matplotlib to create beautiful charts in
a few lines of code. The key difference is Seaborn's default styles and
color palettes, which are designed to be more aesthetically pleasing and
modern. Since Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib, you'll need to know
matplotlib to tweak Seaborn's defaults.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Ggplot}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
ggplot is based on ggplot2, an R plotting system, and concepts from The
Grammar of Graphics. ggplot operates differently than matplotlib: it
lets you layer components to create a complete plot. For instance, you
can start with axes, then add points, then a line, a trendline, etc.
Although The Grammar of Graphics has been praised as an ``intuitive''
method for plotting, seasoned matplotlib users might need time to adjust
to this new mindset.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Bokeh}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Like ggplot, Bokeh is based on The Grammar of Graphics, but unlike
ggplot, it's native to Python, not ported over from R. Its strength lies
in the ability to create interactive, web-ready plots, which can easily
give the output as JSON objects, HTML documents, or interactive web
applications. Bokeh also supports streaming and real-time data.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Pygal}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Like Bokeh and Plotly, pygal offers interactive plots that can be
embedded in the web browser. Its prime differentiator is the ability to
output charts as SVGs. As long as you're working with smaller datasets,
SVGs will do you just fine. But if you're making charts with hundreds of
thousands of data points, they'll have trouble rendering and SVG will
become sluggish.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Plotly}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
You might know Plotly as an online platform for data visualization, but
did you also know you can access its capabilities from a Python
notebook? Like Bokeh, Plotly's forte is making interactive plots, but it
offers some charts you won't find in most libraries, like contour plots,
dendograms, and 3D charts.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Geoplotlib}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
geoplotlib is a toolbox for creating maps and plotting geographical
data. You can use it to create a variety of map-types, like choropleths,
heatmaps, and dot density maps. You must have Pyglet (an object-oriented
programming interface) installed to use geoplotlib. Nonetheless, since
most Python data visualization libraries don't offer maps, it's nice to
have a library dedicated solely to them.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Gleam}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Gleam is inspired by R's Shiny package. It allows you to turn analyses
into interactive web apps using only Python scripts, so you don't have
to know any other languages like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Gleam works
with any Python data visualization library. Once you've created a plot,
you can build fields on top of it so that users can filter and sort
data.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Missingno}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Dealing with missing data is a pain. Missingno allows you to quickly
gauge the completeness of a dataset with a visual summary, instead of
trudging through a table. You can filter and sort data based on
completion or spot correlations with a heatmap or a dendrogram.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.10\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Leather}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.76\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Leather's creator, Christopher Groskopf, puts it best: ``Leather is the
Python charting library for those who need charts now and don't care if
they're perfect.'' It's designed to work with all data types and
produces charts as SVGs, so you can scale them without losing image
quality. Since this library is relatively new, some of the documentation
is still in progress. The charts you can make are pretty basic but
that's the intention.\strut

\subsection{R for Data Visualization: Grammar of
Graphics}\label{r-for-data-visualization-grammar-of-graphics}

\href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html}{Chapter 3 of
Grolemund and Wickham's ``R for Data Science''} (Grolemund and Wickham
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Grammar_Graphics}{2017})

\subsubsection{Layered Grammar of
Graphics:}\label{layered-grammar-of-graphics}

The grammar of graphics is based on the implication that you can
uniquely describe any plot as a combination of

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a dataset
\item
  a geom
\item
  a set of mappings
\item
  a stat
\item
  a position adjustment
\item
  a coordinate system
\item
  a faceting scheme.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Aes/Mapping: Global Mapping and Local
Mapping}\label{aesmapping-global-mapping-and-local-mapping}

\textbf{Formula:}

\[ggplot(data = DATA) +  
GEOMFUNCTION (mapping = aes(MAPPINGS),stat =STAT, position = POSITION ) + COORDINATEFUNCTION + FACETFUNCTION\]

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\begin{verbatim}
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{data_viz_reader_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}

Here, ``mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)'' is a \textbf{global
mapping}, where ``mapping = aes(color = class)'' is a \textbf{local
mapping}.

\subsubsection{Position Adjustment}\label{position-adjustment}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Identity'' position will place each object exactly where it falls in
  the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars.
\item
  ``Fill'' position works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked
  bars the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions
  across groups.
\item
  ``Dodge'' position places overlapping objects directly beside one
  another, which makes it easier to compare individual values.
\item
  ``Jitter'' position adds a small amount of random noise to each point.
  This spreads the points out because no two points are likely to
  receive the same amount of random noise.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Coordinate Systems}\label{coordinate-systems}

The default coordinate system is Cartesian.

\subsection{R Shiny}\label{r-shiny}

R Shiny enables us to produce interactive data visualizations with a
minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Java using a simple web application
framework that runs under the R statistical platform (Castañón
\protect\hyperlink{ref-shiny_interactive_viz}{2016}). Standalone apps
can be hosted on a webpage or embedded in R Markdown documents and
dashboards can be built using R shiny. It combines the computational
power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. The main advantage
of using R Shiny is : Its flexibility of pulling in whatever package in
R that you want to solve your problem, reaping the benefits of an open
source ecosystem for R and JavaScript visualization libraries, thereby
allowing to create highly custom applications and enabling timely, high
quality interactive data experience without (or with much less) web
development and without the limitations or cost of proprietary BI tools.

\subsection{D3.js}\label{d3.js}

D3.js stands for Data-Driven Document, a JS library for interactive Big
Data visualization in literally ANY way required real-time(Cabot
Technology Solution \protect\hyperlink{ref-d3_interactive_viz}{2017}).
This is not a tool, mind you, so a user should have a solid
understanding of JavaScript to work with the data and present it in a
humanly-understandable form. To say more, this library renders the data
into SVG and HTML5 formats, so older browsers like IE7 and 8 cannot
leverage D3.js capabilities.

The data gathered from disparate sources like huge-scale datasets is
bind in real-time with DOM to produce interactive animations ( 2D and 3D
alike) in an extremely rapid way. The D3 architecture allows the users
to intensively reuse the codes across a variety of add-ons and plug-ins.
Some of the key advantages are: It is a dynamic, free and open source
and very flexible with all web technologies, the ability to handle big
data and the functional style allows to reuse the codes.

\textbf{The Hitchhiker' Guide to d3.js} is a wonderful guide for
self-teaching d3.js. This guide is meant to prepare readers mentally as
well as give readers some fruitful directions to pursue. There is a lot
to learn besides the d3.js API, both technical knowledge around web
standards like HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript as well as communication
concepts and data visualization principles. Chances are you know
something about some of those things, so this guide will attempt to give
you good starting points for the things you want to learn more about.

It starts from the insights of learning d3.js by showing interviews with
those top visualization practitioners. Then the author gives key
concepts and useful features for learning visualization like d3-shape,
d3 selection, d3-collection, ds-hierarchy, ds-zoom as well as d3-force.

The guide is helpful as it lists a lot of useful resources links for
learning d3.js. For example, it recommends d3 API Reference, 2000+ d3
case studies and tutorials for d3. It contributes tremendously in doing
exploratory analysis version of group project of this class on d3.
Further, the guide provides information such as some meetup groups in
the bay area, which can be helpful in connecting with data professionals
and building up networks.

\subsection{Tableau}\label{tableau}

Tableau is amid the market leaders for the Big Data visualization,
especially efficient for delivering interactive data visualization for
the results derived from Big Data operations, deep learning algorithms
and multiple types of AI-driven apps (AbsentData
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tableau_interactive_viz}{2018}).

Tableau can be integrated with Amazon AWS, MySQL, Hadoop, Teradata ,and
SAP, making this solution a versatile tool for creating detailed graphs
and intuitive data representation. This way the C-suite and middle-chain
managers are able to make grounded decisions based on informative and
easily-readable Tableau graphs.

Tableau is a business intelligence (BI) and analytics platform created
for the purposes of helping people see, understand and make decisions
with data. It is the industry leader in interactive data visualization
tools, offering a broad range of maps, charts, graphs, and more
graphical data presentations. It is a painless option when cost is not a
concern and you do not need advanced and complex analysis. The
application is very handy for quickly visualizing trends in data,
connecting to a variety of data sources, and mapping cities/regions and
their associated data.

The following tips for Tableau are still missing:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Running totals
\item
  Common Baseline
\item
  Weighted averages
\item
  Moving average

  Different years comparison
\item
  Appending excel sheets
\item
  Bar chart totals
\item
  Fixed axis when re-drawing charts
\item
  Auto-fitting screen behavior depending on data selection
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key advantages}:

\item
  It provides a non-technical user the ability to build complex reports
  and dashboard with zero coding skills.
\item
  Using drag-n-drop functionalities of Tableau, user can create a very

\item
  It can handle millions of rows of data with ease and users can make
  live to connections to different data sources like SQL etc (``Data
  Visualization Best Practices''
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-VizBP}{2017})(``The Extreme Presentation
  Method'' NA).

\textbf{Building advanced analytics application with TabPy}: Imagine a
scenario where we can just enter some x values in a dashboard form, and
the visualization would predict the y variable!!! Here is a link that
shows how to integrate and visualize data from Python in Tableau. This
is especially relevant to all data science students, as this is one of
the tools used for visualizing advanced analytics. The author here has
given an example using data from Seattle's police department's 911 calls
and he tries to identify criminal hotspots in the area. The author uses
machine learning (spatial clustering) and creates a great interactive
visualization, where you can click on the type of criminal activity and
the graph will show various clusters. There are other examples and use
cases that may be downloaded, and the scripts are also given by the
author to anyone who is interested in trying it out. (Beran
\protect\hyperlink{ref-TabPy}{2017})

\subsection{Google chart}\label{google-chart}

A free and powerful integration of all Google power. The tool is
rendering the resulting charts to HTML5/SVG, so they are compatible with
any browser. Support for VML ensures compatibility with older IE
versions, and the charts can be ported to the latest releases of Android
and iOS. What's even more important, Google chart combines the data from
multiple Google services like Google Maps. This results in producing
interactive charts that absorb data real-time and can be controlled
using an interactive dashboard (``Top 4 Big Data Visualization Tools''
\protect\hyperlink{ref-top4_viz_tools}{2018}).

\section{Special Topics}\label{special-topics}

\subsection{Data Mining and Data
Visualization}\label{data-mining-and-data-visualization}

(EDUCBA \protect\hyperlink{ref-data_mining}{2018})

According to a paper in 2018, we can tell the difference between data
mining and data visualizations. Here is a chart that helps us understand
this better.

\textbf{Data Mining} involves different processes such as data
extraction, data management, data transformations, data pre-processing,
etc.

\textbf{Data Visualization}, the primary goal is to convey the
information efficiently and clearly without any deviations or
complexities in the form of statistical graphs, information graphs, and
plots.

The author has also listed top 7 comparisons between data mining and
data visualization, and 12 key differences between them. The article
provides a very clear understanding of each of these techniques.

Business}\label{data-visualization-in-business}

\subsection{Data Visualizations in
Industry}\label{data-visualizations-in-industry}

Companies tend to rely on dashboards (a compilation of several related
data visualizations) to give them high-level insights on company-wide,
market-level, or employee-level performance. The following are some
common applications of dashboards in business.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Application}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Description}\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Sales \& Marketing}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
This is one of the most popular uses for dashboards. Companies like to
regularly track their revenue, conversions, lead sources, etc. and rely
on data visualization to synthesize these large and constantly updated
data into visual summaries.Funnel reporting in terms of sales velocity
and efficiency, comparing ROI, distribution of opportunities and leads
across region, time, etc. are some of the matrices which requires
dashboards and visualization on latest as well as historic data. Sales
are Marketing teams are one of the major consumers of BI tools driven
reporting and monitoring dashboards.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Customer Success}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
These dashboards can be created by the team, but are also often built
into customer service platforms such as Zendesk. They include various
KPIs of the customer success team, such as the ratio of tickets open to
tickets closed and time to resolution.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Product Management}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
These dashboards tend to synthesize sales, marketing, and customer
research data together and are typically used for executive reporting.
The visuals display metrics such as dollars and hours devoted to various
projects and most requested features by customers.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Clinical Performance Management}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Data visualizations are also helpful in the healthcare industry to
monitor healthcare systems operations, clinical performance monitoring
and patient profiling. Healthcare provider organizations (hospitals and
health systems) can better examine their clinical, administrative and
financial data to support clinical costing and resource coordination,
better-planned care for patients and provide competitive advantage
alongside maintaining quality standards.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Finance}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Finance is another popular domain where dashboards help cover a variety
of aspects such as- profit \& loss, cash flow management, revenue,
profit margin, cost heads etc. Finance dashboards can often be helpful
in identifying trends on revenue, profitability, cash flows, accounts
payable, day sales outstanding and so on. A key area to leverage finance
dashboards is identifying performance of key metrics over a period of
time and creating and comparing performance against internal (and/or
external) benchmarks. There is no dearth of data that can flow into a
financial dashboard!\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.16\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Human Resources}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Human resource is another critical functional domain where dashboards
and reporting play a key role. HR and People Analysts are actively hired
across organizations for measuring employee productivity, attrition or
turnover rates, understanding training costs per employee, recruiting
conversion rate, average employee retention period, cost per hire and so
on. Human resource can constitute one of the major cost heads for most
service companies and hence drives the need for HR management and
reporting.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Data visualization is also used across many different industries. One
popular area right now is healthcare, especially involving big data. The
benefits and uses of interactive data viz are detailed in a paper from
the University of Maryland (2013). (Schneiderman
\protect\hyperlink{ref-data_viz_healthcare}{2013})

\textbf{The paper highlights three types of data that can and should be
visualized to help in decision-making: personal, clinical, and public
health information.} Examples include: exploration of prescription
patterns of different drugs and tracking personal health and fitness
statistics. (Even the nice, clean Fitbit app home screen is a
comprehensive dashboard!) Importantly, making sense of all this data
collected from individuals will help healthcare organizations and
companies provide more personalized and effective health treatment.

According to an Experian report, 95\% of U.S. organizations say that
they use data to power business opportunities, and another 84 percent
believe data is an integral part of forming a business strategy.
Visualization helps data impact business in following ways:

\subsubsection{Cleaning}\label{cleaning}

The simplest way to explain the importance of visualization is to look
at visualization as a means of making sense of data. Even the most
basic, widely-used data visualization tools that combine simple pie
charts and bar graphs help people comprehend large amounts of
information fast and easily, compared to paper reports and spreadsheets.

In other words, visualization is the initial filter for the quality of
data streams. Combining data from various sources, visualization tools
perform preliminary standardization, shape data in a unified way and
create easy-to-verify visual objects. As a result, these tools become
indispensable for data cleansing and vetting and help companies prepare
quality assets to derive valuable insights. Data cleansing is typically
done by using instance reduction techniques.

Instance reduction: It helps to reduce the size of the data set without
compromising the quality of insights that can be extracted from the
data. It removes instances and generates new ones to make the data set
compact. There are two major instance reduction algorithms:

Instance selection: It is used to identify the best examples from a very
large dataset with many instances in order to curate them as the input
for the analytics system. It aims to select a subset of the data that
can act as a replacement for the original dataset while completely
fulfilling the goal. It will also remove redundant instances and noise.

Instance generation: It involves replacing the original data with
artificially generated data in order to fill regions in the domain of an
issue with no representative examples in the master data. A common
approach is to relabel examples that appear to belong to wrong class
labels. Instance generation thus makes the data clean and ready for the
analysis algorithm.

\subsubsection{Extraction}\label{extraction}

Known versatile tools for data visualization and analytics like Elastic
Stack, Tableau, Highcharts, and more complex database solutions like
Hadoop, Amazon AWS,and Teradata, have wide applications in business,
from monitoring performance to improving customer experience on mobile
tools. The new generation of data visualization based on AR and VR
technology, however, provides formerly unfeasible advantages in terms of
identifying patterns and drawing insights from various data streams.

Building 3D data visualization spaces, companies can create an intuitive
environment that helps data scientists grasp and analyze more data
streams at the same time, observe data points from multiple dimensions,
identify previously unavailable dependencies and manipulate data by
naturally moving objects, zooming, and focusing on more granulated
areas. Moreover, these tools allow us to expand the capabilities of data
visualization by creating collaborative 3D environments for teams. As a
result, new technology helps extract more valuable insights from the
same volume of data.

Data has shown phenomenal growth over the past decade and its widespread
application by businesses as a growth catalyst continues to deliver
positive results. The scale of data is massive and the volume, velocity,
and variety of data call for more efficient processing to make it
machine-ready. Although there is a multitude of ways to extract data
such as public APIs, custom web scraping services, internal data
sources, etc., there would always remain the need to do some
pre-processing to make the data perfectly suitable for business
applications. Data pre-processing techniques like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data Cleansing
\item
  Data Manipulation
\item
  Data Normalization
\item
  Data Transformation
\item
  Missing Values Imputation
\item
  Noise Identification
\item
  Minimizing the Pre-processing Tasks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{play a key role in the process.}

\subsubsection{Strategizing}\label{strategizing}

As the amount of data grows, it becomes harder to catch up with it.
Therefore, data strategy becomes the necessary part of the success in
applying data to businesses. Then how data visualization become an
important tool in your strategic kit?

First, it helps you clean your data. Secondly, it allows you to identify
and extract meaningful information from it. Finally, data visualization
tools enable continuous real-time monitoring of how your strategy and
now data-driven decisions influence performance and business outcomes.
In other words, these tools visualize not only the data, but also the
results, and help correct and optimize strategy on the go.

Data visualization is one of the initial and most important steps made
to derive value from data. It determines how efficiently analysts can
work with data assets, what insights they are able to extract and how
their data strategy will develop over time.

Therefore, the quality and capabilities of data visualization directly
influence how data impacts your business strategy and what benefits data
applications can bring to the companies and their industries.

\subsection{Corporate Scorecards and Data
Visualization}\label{corporate-scorecards-and-data-visualization}

Corporate transparency, flat organizations, open book policies, etc. are
terms executives and entrepreneurs learn about all the time (Boost Labs
\protect\hyperlink{ref-SCORECARDS}{2015}). As the corporate world shifts
towards a more open culture, the demand for open data and insights have
increased dramatically. This shift has helped the overall corporate
strategic planning and management process easing the alignment of
business activities towards a series of goals. Being transparent top
down aligns the culture to sail towards the same North Star.

The growth of corporate transparency is not only important internally,
but externally as well. Corporate certifications like B Corporations
certifications (B Corp), require companies to provide a transparent view
of their social conscious efforts to the general public. Achieving the
certification is one step of the process; the true goal is to show the
world how and why the certification is truly deserved.

Here's the process on how to get it done.

Before this step it is easy to underestimate the effort level it takes
to pull the best insights from the data. Data manipulation products like
Tableau, Domo, Pentaho, IBM's Many Eyes, and R, among others, make
insight extraction that much easier to gain understanding of data using
a visual medium. The key is to start with a simple portion of your data
and to start pulling basic insights to visualize and correlate with each
other. This process leads towards a compound series of questions, which
helps provide an overall vision to the end product. We see the effect
during our discovery process, which leads to unforeseen avenues for data
intelligence.\strut

such as Hadoop have helped by unifying disparate data sources, but other
options such as data cloud environments can help produce API's for
future product deployments. Why is this important? Accessibility of data
is an important foundation not only within the context of dashboards,
but also the possibility of branching out to other products.\strut

\subsection{Typography and Data
Visualization}\label{typography-and-data-visualization}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Definition of typography
\end{enumerate}

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written
language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography}{WIKI})

The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line
lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and
adjusting the space between pairs of letters.

\subsubsection{Preattentive visual attributes and
typography}\label{preattentive-visual-attributes-and-typography}

While data components such as quantitative or categorical data are
commonly represented by visual features like colors, sizes or shapes,
utilization of boldface, font variation, other typographic elements in
data visualization are less prevalent.

Preattentive attributes are those that perceptual psychologists have
determined to be easily recognized by the human brain irrespective of
how many items are displayed. Therefore, ``preattentive visual
attributes are desirable in data visualization as they can demand
attention only when a target is present, can be difficult to ignore, and
are virtually unaffected by load.'' Examples of preattentive attributes
are size/area, hue, and curvature.

This brings us to the disparate situation of the popularity of visual
aspects like color and size and typographic aspects such as font
variation, capitalization and bold. The authors present several possible
reasons for this, beginning with the preattentiveness of visual
attributes like size and hue. However, some typographic attributes such
as line width or size, intensity, or font weight (a combination of the
two) are considered preattentive as well.

Furthermore, these visual attributes are inherently more viscerally
powerful, and they are easy to code in a variety of programming
languages. Technology has also perhaps previously limited the use of
typographic attributes, for only recently have fine details such as
serifs, italics, etc. been made readily visible to the audiences of data
visualizations by technological advances.

\subsubsection{Why typography is not currently popular in data
visualizations}\label{why-typography-is-not-currently-popular-in-data-visualizations}

The authors remark that it is possible the lack of variety of
typographic elements used in data visualizations is due to the limited
knowledge of computer scientists and other individuals pursuing data
visualization in how to apply these elements effectively. While the
first few proposed explanations make sense from personal experience with
technology and exposure to data visualizations and design in general,
the hypothesis that lack of knowledge of typographic elements in data
visualization seems more plausible if it was being applied to a small
group of people rather than all of the data visualization design
community. It is more likely that the use of typographic elements in
data visualization is less popular because there are fewer instances in
which it can be used appropriately, or a status quo bias if current
visual attributes are received well, the prevailing attitude may be not
to fix what is not broken. However, the authors also point out that
despite the dearth of typographic attributes in data visualization,
other spheres like cartography, mathematics, chemistry, and programming
have a rich history with type and font attributes that informs the scope
of the parameter space?

\subsubsection{Tips for using typographic attributes in
visualizations}\label{tips-for-using-typographic-attributes-in-visualizations}

The authors continue by pointing out some tips for using typographic
attributes to encode different data types, since certain attributes may
be suited to particular purposes. For example, font weight (size and
intensity) is ideal for representing quantitative or ordered data, and
font type (shape) is better suited to denote categories in the data.

Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic
attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility and the
ability to read lines and blocks of words. Often, interactivity of a
visualization will not only improve functionality, but also provide a
solution to readability issues by providing a means to zoom in on small
text.

There are a few examples of unusual/innovative use of typography for
data visualization in the article, not all of which we agree are made
more effective by the interesting utilization of typographic attributes,
but the ``Who Survived the Titanic'' visualization's use of typographic
attributes allowed it to not only answer macro-questions very quickly,
such as if women and children were actually first to be evacuated across
classes, but also to provide answers to micro-questions, like whether or
not the Astors survived. It used common visual elements like color and
area to indicate whether or not a person survived and number/proportion
of people, as well as typographic aspects like italic and simple text
replacement to indicate gender and the passengers' names.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/TypographicTitanic.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Criticisms of typography}\label{criticisms-of-typography}

The authors round out the article by addressing the most common
criticisms of typography in data visualization, the foremost one being
whether or not text should even be considered an element of data
visualization, since visualization connotes preattentive visual encoding
of information, and text or sequential information necessitates more
investment of attention to understand.

Another criticism is that textual representations are not as visually
appealing even when used effectively. However, the authors counter that
``this criticism indicates both the strength and weakness of type? that
while text may not be suited for adding style or drama to a
visualization, it can be particularly powerful in situations where a
finer level of detail is needed, without sacrificing representation of
higher-level patterns.

Lastly, a label length problem is common when using text in
visualizations; differing lengths of names or labels may skew perception
so that longer labels seem more important than shorter labels. This
problem was encountered in the Titanic visualization with the varying
lengths representations of passengers' names and was corrected by only
including a given name and a surname, the length of which could only
vary so much.

\subsection{Infographics vs.~Data
Visualizations}\label{infographics-vs.data-visualizations-1}

Data visualization and infographics both present visual information to
users. While their purposes may seem similar, they actually have
different use cases. This article explains the differences between an
infographic and a data visualization (Pritchard
\protect\hyperlink{ref-VIZVSINFO}{2016}).

\subsubsection{Data Visualization vs
Infographics}\label{data-visualization-vs-infographics}

Data visualization usually involves the presentation of summary
statistics using visual forms such as graphs, plots or charts; its goal
is to provide clear and succinct information about your research. Data
visualization also typically focuses on the two important aspects of
data and design. However, design should actually depend on the data
itself; for example, the type of chart used in a data visualization
should be selected based on which one best displays the particular data
set. Since visualizations are important in telling stories (such as
trends), it should avoid adding extraneous and distracting details. Data
visualizations should be self-explanatory, and users should be able to
draw conclusions on their own.

An infographic on the other hand, is typically a combination of
illustrations, facts, and text. Infographics might include some
components characteristic of data visualization, but in general feature
a less data-driven storytelling. While infographics are not grounded in
data, like data visualizations, infographics convey several ideas
simultaneously; and like data visualization, the design should be both
visually appealing and should be based in the function of conveying the
visual story.

Furthermore, as in typography and cartography, use of typographic
attributes in data visualization raises concerns of legibility, the
ability to understand both individual characters and commonalities that
identify a font family, and readability, the ability to read lines and
blocks of words. Often, the interactivity of a visualization will not
only improve functionality but also provide a solution to readability
issues by providing a means to zoom in on small text.

\subsubsection{When Should You Use Infographics or Data
Visualization?}\label{when-should-you-use-infographics-or-data-visualization-1}

While both infographics and data visualizations have their own distinct
use cases, more often than not they can be used together. Some of the
effective ways to choose between them are described below.

case studies help show that new designs are just as usable as existing
techniques, demonstrating that the field is suitable for future
development.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}

Visualization is like art; it speaks where words fail. The usefulness of
data visualizations is not just limited to business and analytics;
visualizations can explain almost anything in the world. Wars, rescue
operations, social issues, etc. can be visualized to synthesize the
details important details relevant to the issues. In particular,
phenomena like the Syrian war, the number flights during Thanksgiving in
the USA, the controversy of `\#OscarsSoWhite,' etc. present such
complexity that we can write endless paragraphs and still fail to
convince readers. Below are visualizations of some of these important
and complex topics - visualizations that are much more persuasive than
an essay, and with a tiny fraction of the text.

\section{Geographic Visualizations}\label{geographic-visualizations}

Often, people use maps to visualize data that should not be mapped. Here
are some examples of when a map visualization is a good choice.

\subsection{Spies in the Skies}\label{spies-in-the-skies}

The map below is from a Buzzfeed article (Aldhous and Seife
\protect\hyperlink{ref-spies_sky}{2016}) that shows how common it is for
the government to observe people. It was filled with red and blue lines
(representing FBI and DHS aircraft, respectively) which illustrate the
flight paths of the planes. When planes circle an area more than once,
the circles become darker. The circles change by day and time, and
individual cities can be typed into a search bar to see the flight
patterns over them. The visualization rather creatively looks almost
like a hand-drawn map. While presenting an ordinarily uncomfortable
topic, this allows individuals to check things for themselves, hopefully
providing some peace of mind.

\subsection{Two Centuries of U.S.
Immigration}\label{two-centuries-of-u.s.-immigration}

This interactive map from (Galka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-immigration}{2016}) shows the rate of immigration
into the U.S. from other countries over the last 200 years in 10-year
segments. Each colored dot represents 10,000 people coming from the
specified country. Countries then light up when they have one of the
highest rates of migration. A tracker on the left indicates what
countries sent the most people to the U.S. at what times.

This is a good visualization because it is engaging and easy to read and
interpret. The movement of the dots draws the reader's attention while
the brightly lit countries make it easy to pick out the highest total
migrations. The bright colors and dark background help the information
stand out. This map is a bit simple, but effective.

\subsection{Uber: Crafting Data-Driven
Maps}\label{uber-crafting-data-driven-maps}

Map visualization is essential for companies like Uber that need to
track metrics using geo-space points. In this article, the designer from
Uber talks about the challenges of designing such visualizations and the
possible solutions (Klimczak \protect\hyperlink{ref-uber_maps}{2016}).

The challenges that Uber faced when crafting geospatial visualizations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are great individual maps but as a whole lack of consistency
  across the company.
\item
  Common graphing tools like Sketch does not support GIS file, which is
  essential to Uber's insights.
\item
  The scale of the framework includes more than 400 cities in the world
  with a variety of different geographic features and data types.
\end{enumerate}

To tackle these problems, Uber started by defining base map themes by
optimizing detail, color, and typography. Based on that, data layers are
added using scatter plots and hex bins, with careful color selection to
help their team make decisions. To make it even better, Uber took a
further step by adding trip lines (see images below), which became a
signature visualization of Uber. Choropleths are also used to help
visualize how metrics and values differ across geographic areas. Uber
uses US postal codes as geographic boundaries and infuses various
datasets to create the color variation.

The visualization in this article is a classic problem of visualizing
geographic data. The detailed explanation of the problems and how they
are solved can be beneficial for people or startups trying to
conceptualize and make appropriate visualizations that support the
decision-making process.

\section{Demographic Comparisons}\label{demographic-comparisons}

One common use of visualization is to compare different groups against
each other, such as political parties or generations.

\subsection{Young Voters, Class and Turnout: How Britain Voted in
2017}\label{young-voters-class-and-turnout-how-britain-voted-in-2017}

This article's goal is to convey the change in party votes in the 2017
UK general election compared to votes in 2015 (Holder, Barr, and
Kommenda \protect\hyperlink{ref-UKvotes2017}{2017}). The change in party
votes was shown with regards to three demographic factors: age, class,
and ethnicity. For each factor, there are four graphs (one per political
party), each illustrated in the party's standard color. The change in
the percent of votes is shown as an arrow where the arrow's shaft is the
length of the difference from 2015 to 2017 while the x-axis is the
demographic factor split into different bins.

This a good visualization because it is straightforward to read and
interpret. The color-coding of the arrows and party names makes it easy
to pick out the different parties. The index is smartly spread across
the visualization to reduce cross-referencing, and color in the graph
represents the actual party colors in the campaign. The arrow lengths
highlight just how significant of a change happened. For example, in the
Age section, it is easy to see the pattern between the Labour party
gaining many voters aged 18 to 44 and the Conservative party gaining
voters aged 45 and up.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Party_Votes_by_Age.png}
\caption{UK Party Votes by Age}
\end{figure}

\subsection{U.S. Migration Patterns}\label{u.s.-migration-patterns}

The New York Times data team mapped out Americans' moving patterns from
1900 to present, and the results are fascinating to interact with
(Aisch, Gebeloff, and Quealy \protect\hyperlink{ref-migration}{2014}).
We can see where people living in each state were born, and where people
are moving to and from. The groupings of the destinations vary based on
that state's trends, preventing unnecessary clutter while still showing
detail when vital, as can be seen by the difference between the charts
for California and Pennsylvania.

Overall, this type of chart can work well to visualize movement in data
over time, such as with migration. However, it must be done carefully to
maintain clarity. Too many categories with colors and crossing lines can
make it difficult for a reader to keep track of what the data is saying
and it can quickly go from a very graphic visualization to a chaotic
mess of lines. The designer does a pretty good job with these
visualizations by limiting the number of categories in grouping states
by region (West, South, Midwest, etc.). However, it is not completely
clear why so many crossing lines are necessary for the Pennsylvania
chart. The crossing lines, along with the use of the same color for
different lines within the same regional categories, can introduce
unnecessary complexity.

\subsection{The American Workday}\label{the-american-workday}

NPR tapped into American Time Use Survey data to ascertain the share of
workers in a wide range of industries who are at work at any given time
(Quoctrung Bui \protect\hyperlink{ref-NPR_workday}{2014}). The original
question of when Americans work, rather than the number of hours worked,
is answered in the graph. The chart overlays the traditional 9 AM-5 PM
standard workday as a reference point, helping the audience draw
exciting conclusions. Below is a screenshot of the data product; the
original graph is more interactive and allows the audience to explore
when people are working for different occupations.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/npr_workday.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Some interesting findings include: 1. Construction workers both start
and finish their workday earlier and generally do not work at lunch
hours as there is a massive drop at noon.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/construction.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Servers and cooks' schedule are the opposite of all other occupations
  with the peak from lunch through the evening.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/server_cook.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Protective services, e.g., police officers, firefighters, and
  detectives, have many workers working throughout the night, which is
  entirely different from all other occupations.
  \includegraphics{images/protective.png}
\end{enumerate}

This data product is an excellent example because the analytic design
has been applied to contrast specific occupations to the traditional 9-5
working hours. This is easy to understand and make particular
occupations stand out more manageable. The use of color for highlighting
the selected occupation in the graph helps to categorize different
occupations as well.

\subsection{How People Like You Spend Their
Time}\label{how-people-like-you-spend-their-time}

This visualization from (Yau \protect\hyperlink{ref-spendingtime}{2016})
lists several categories such as ``personal care'' and ``work'' along
one side of a graph with a line illustrating the amount of time the
average person in a particular demographic spends on each subject.
Entering different parameters at the top, such as changing gender or
age, causes the lines to shift to feature that demographic. The
simplicity of this visualization helps the information get across and
avoids bogging down the statistics. Sometimes, less is more.

\subsection{Britain's Diet In Data}\label{britains-diet-in-data}

This is an excellent example about how to present a significant amount
of comprehensive data - distributed across different categories and
measured in different metrics - in a simple yet effective manner, while
still maintaining interest and aesthetics. The data product attempts to
show how the average Briton's diet has changed over the last four
decades for the better (Institute
\protect\hyperlink{ref-britain_diet_2016}{2016}). It does this by
displaying simple trend lines that show that more harmful and fatty
foods are being consumed less while consumed more healthier and leaner
foods. It further breaks down every major food category into tens of its
constituent products, and in both the overview and deep-dive versions,
provides further levers to massage more meaning out of the data. It also
shows how the contribution of different foods to the typical diet has
changed over the years. Here, we can toggle the year to see exactly how
much of each food was consumed, again with another deep-dive into the
constituents of every primary food group.

\includegraphics{images/britain-diet-data-trends.PNG} Source: (Institute
\protect\hyperlink{ref-britain_diet_2016}{2016})
\includegraphics{images/britain-diet-data-typical_diet.png}

Such a visualization is ideal for a layman who would want to walk away
with an immediate and accurate understanding of the overall dietary
changes. It also provides plenty detail on demand for the more
discerning viewer who might have more time and inclination to dissect
and parse through the graphs. It is difficult to use the same data
product to cater to both types of viewers in such an adequate capacity,
which is what makes this particular data product so impressive and
useful. It satisfies the principles of graphical excellence as stated by
Edward Tufte : \textgreater{}``Graphical excellence is that which gives
to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the
least ink in the smallest space.''

Reference: (Tufte \protect\hyperlink{ref-visual_display}{1983})

\subsection{Selfie City}\label{selfie-city}

Selfie City, a detailed multi-component visual exploration of 3,200
selfies from five major cities around the world, offers a close look at
the demographics and trends of selfies (Manovich et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-selfie}{2014}). This project is based on a unique
dataset compiled by analyzing tens of thousands of images from each
city, both through automatic image analysis and human judgment. The team
behind the project collected and filtered the data using Instagram and
Mechanical Turk. Rich media visualizations (imageplots) assemble
thousands of photos to reveal interesting patterns. It provides a
demographic and regional comparison of selfies.

\begin{figure}
\centering

\caption{Estimated Age and Gender Distribution}
\end{figure}

(Source: (Manovich et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-selfie}{2014}))

\subsection{Evolving Demographics}\label{evolving-demographics}

Another frequent use is to look at how something changes over time.
Time-series data can be shown many ways, and these are some examples.

\subsubsection{Millennial Generation
Diversity}\label{millennial-generation-diversity}

CNNMoney created an interactive chart using U.S. Census Data to show the
size and diversity of the millennial generation compared to baby boomers
(Kurtz and Yellin \protect\hyperlink{ref-age_groups}{2018}). While the
article's main point is that the millennial generation is bigger and
more diverse than the baby boomer generation, it also contains
information about all of the other living generations. It turns hard
numbers into an intriguing story, illustrating the racial makeup of
different age groups from 1913 to present.

The author also summarized three key findings from the graph:
1\textbar{} The most common age in the US is 22 years old. 2\textbar{}
The median age in the US is 37.6 years old. * 3\textbar{} Among the
youngest generation, only 50\% of the population is white with the
potential of dropping from the biggest race in the US.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/millenials_diversity.png}
\caption{Racial Diversity of US Generations}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Kurtz and Yellin \protect\hyperlink{ref-age_groups}{2018}))

This is an effective graph because while it contains many data points,
it makes the overall trends very clear without sacrificing much detail.
You can see the drop in some white people and the increasing growth of
the other racial categories.

\subsubsection{How the Recession Reshaped the Economy, in 255
Charts}\label{how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts}

The first large graph contains 255 lines to show how the number of jobs
has changed for every industry in America, using color to highlight the
lines and let viewers see the specifics for each industry (Ashkenas and
Parlapiano \protect\hyperlink{ref-recession_economy}{2014}). By hovering
over a line, viewers can get the detailed information of that industry's
job trend. Keeping this extra data hidden until needd will make it
easier for readers to absorb the bigger picture from this vast data
visualization.\\
Following charts are subsets categorized by job sector and
sub-industries. Readers can choose the industry or sector they are
interested in and, similar to the first graph, view the more detailed
information by hovering over a line.

\begin{figure}

\subsubsection{An Aging Population: Projected Number of Children and
Older
Adults}\label{an-aging-population-projected-number-of-children-and-older-adults}

An aging population is always a hot topic in social economics and
politics (United States Census Bureau
\protect\hyperlink{ref-aging_nation}{2018}). Here we explore a
collection of data visualizations showing the aging population in the
U.S. and the world.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/aging_nation.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source:(United States Census Bureau
\protect\hyperlink{ref-aging_nation}{2018}))

This example includes a bar chart and a line graph to demonstrate the
aging population compared with the population of children. This
visualization allows easy comparison, employs color to differentiate the
categories, and highlights the intersection point.

\subsubsection{From Pyramid to Pillar: A Century of Change, Population
of the
U.S.}\label{from-pyramid-to-pillar-a-century-of-change-population-of-the-u.s.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Pyramid.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This is a \textbf{population pyramid}. ``A \textbf{population pyramid}
is a pair of back-to-back histograms for each sex that displays the
distribution of a population in all age groups and in gender'' (Bureau
\protect\hyperlink{ref-population_pyramid}{2018}\protect\hyperlink{ref-population_pyramid}{b}).
It is good to visualize changes in population distributions (sex, age,
year). The shape of a pyramid is also used to represent other
characteristics of a population. To illustrate, A pyramid with a very
wide base and a narrow top section suggests a population with both high
fertility and death rates. It is a useful tool to make sense of census
data. (``An Aging Population'' NA) offers an animated pyramid.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/3_1.png}
\caption{Comparison of aging population in US and Japan}
\end{figure}

(Source:(``An Aging Population'' NA))

This is an animated and multiple-population pyramid. It used to compare
different patterns across countries. One additional benefit for the
interactive population pyramid is that it shows the shape changes by
year, which is useful for time-series comparison. A similar project with
R code is
\href{https://www.r-bloggers.com/who-is-old-visualizing-the-concept-of-prospective-ageing-with-animated-population-pyramids/}{here}.

\subsubsection{Music Timeline}\label{music-timeline}

Google's Music Timeline illustrates a variety of music genres waxing and
waning in popularity from 2010 to the present day, based on how many
Google Play Music users have an artist or album in their library, and
other data such as album release dates (Google
\protect\hyperlink{ref-google_music}{2014}). One useful feature of this
graph is the reader's ability to explore one specific genre and its
subgenres at a more detailed level, as well as view the general timeline
of all music. The drill-down interaction allows for more details without
cluttering the overview of the visualization. Embedding the graph with
names (e.g., Rock/Pop) makes similar color lines easy to distinguish.

\section{Animated Data Visualization}\label{animated-data-visualization}

Like evolving demographics, these visualizations are demographics that
change over time. These, however, are self-animated instead of
interactive.

\subsection{A Day in the Life of
Americans}\label{a-day-in-the-life-of-americans}

This animated data visualization shows the time people spend on daily
activities throughout the day (Nathan Yau
\protect\hyperlink{ref-American_life}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-American_life}{b}).
The plot is simple and easy to interpret, but it also includes a good
number of variables including time, activity type, number of people
doing each activity, and the order in which activities are done.

One of the plot's biggest strengths is that by using one dot to
represent each person in the study and using animation, we can drill
down to the level of an individual and follow him or her throughout the
day. The accumulation of dots for each particular activity also gives us
an aggregate-level view of the same data, so that we get both individual
and aggregate insights.

A drawback of the plot is that it is hard for our eyes to keep track of
1000 simultaneously moving dots. The author of the post addresses this
by creating subsequent plots with stationary lines at crucial times of
the day. This represents people's movements from one activity to another
without overwhelming the reader.

Overall, this is an engaging, informative, relevant, and fun animated
plot that tells a story.

\begin{figure}

\subsection{Hans Rosling's 200 Countries, 200 Years, 4
Minutes}\label{hans-roslings-200-countries-200-years-4-minutes}

Global health data expert Hans Rosling's famous statistical documentary
``The Joy of Stats'' aired on BBC in 2010, but it is still turning
heads. In the remarkable segment ``200 Countries, 200 Years, 4
Minutes'', Rosling uses augmented reality to explore public health data
in 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers, in just four
minutes (Rosling, Hans \protect\hyperlink{ref-hans_rosling}{2010}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/200_countries_years.png}
\caption{Screenshot from ``200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes''}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Rosling, Hans \protect\hyperlink{ref-hans_rosling}{2010}))

What makes this visualization so well-known is its use of animation and
narration to highlight different stories within the overall data. While
the visualization could have been made as an interactive chart where the
audience can select the year, instead it is a video. Rosling's narration
of how various regions have fluctuated over the last two hundred years
is necessary for his argument since there is no other description or
explanation.

\section{Dust in the Wind: Visualization and Environmental
Problems}\label{dust-in-the-wind-visualization-and-environmental-problems}

Environmental issues can quickly become extremely complex. When dealing
with assessments of site, environmental remediation design, monitoring,
environmental litigation, the quantity of data involved can quickly
become overwhelming. Maintaining and organizing that data and keep a
balance is insufficient. Visualization is the only means for condensing
and communicating vast quantities of data. Visualization provides an
invaluable tool to communicate complex data in a form that makes it
intelligible to all parties. There are many case studies on
visualization of environment-related issues. Some of them are mentioned
below:

\subsection{Global Carbon Emissions}\label{global-carbon-emissions}

This data visualization, based on data from the World Resource
Institute's Climate Analysis Indicators Tool and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, shows how national CO₂ emissions have
transformed over the last 150 years and what the future might hold. It
also allows the audience to explore emissions by country for a range of
different scenarios (World Resources Institute
\protect\hyperlink{ref-CO2_emission}{2014}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/carbon_emissions.png}

\end{figure}

(Source: (World Resources Institute
\protect\hyperlink{ref-CO2_emission}{2014}))

\subsection{What's really warming the
world?}\label{whats-really-warming-the-world}

This case study begins by clearly explaining necessary background
information and the analytic questions it seeks to answer. Next, it
analyzes each factor separately using both verbal explanations and
dynamic graphics to compare the observed temperature movements, and then
categorizes related factors into ``natural factors'' or ``human
factors.'' After that, it combines all the dynamic graphics into one,
which makes the results more accessible and more straightforward to
compare. Lastly, the authors provide further detailed explanations of
dataset sources to support their results. Overall, this case study is
straightforward, easy to understand and informative (Roston and
Migliozzi \protect\hyperlink{ref-world_warming}{2015}) (Crooks
\protect\hyperlink{ref-int_viz_capt}{2017}).

\begin{figure}

\subsection{Understanding Plastic pollution using
visualization}\label{understanding-plastic-pollution-using-visualization}

Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic products in the
environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or
humans. Human usage of plastic has increased manifolds in last few
decades. Since plastic is inexpensive and durable, it has a wide variety
of uses in our everyday life. Since the 1950's, an estimated 6.3 billion
tons of plastic has been produced, of which only about 9\% is recycled
(contributors \protect\hyperlink{ref-wiki_plastic_pollution}{2019}).

\textbf{Usage of plastic in last few decades} (Gr?n
\protect\hyperlink{ref-plastic_pollution_visualizations}{2016}):
\includegraphics{images/global_plastic_usage.png}

Plastic has become part of our daily life, and human dependence on
plastic has increased over time. The visualization below shows some
common plastic products undermining environmental health. (Gr?n
\protect\hyperlink{ref-plastic_pollution_visualizations}{2016})

\textbf{What is plastic used for.} (Gr?n
\protect\hyperlink{ref-plastic_pollution_visualizations}{2016})
\includegraphics{images/use_of_plastic.png}

With a share of 26 percent, China may be the largest plastic producer in
the world; yet the largest plastic consumer is neighboring Japan. The
people living in the island nation have consumption that exceeds that of
Africa and the rest of Asia combined.

Donut chart is a modern version of pie-chart which looks cleaner, and
embedded visual imagery makes the distribution easy to understand. (Gr?n
\protect\hyperlink{ref-plastic_pollution_visualizations}{2016})

\textbf{Plastic Use: Industrial nations top the charts} (Gr?n
\protect\hyperlink{ref-plastic_pollution_visualizations}{2016})

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/plastic_use.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This visualization uses a simple line chart to show increasing trends. A
positive aspect of this chart is the removal of the vertical grid which
creates noise in the visualization when its objective is to show the
trend, rather than the numbers.

\textbf{Visualization of Ocean Plastic collection: This worldview
visualization shows how much plastic is in our oceans.}(Moret
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ocean_plastic_pollution}{2014})
\includegraphics{images/Ocean_Plasticpollution.jpg}

\textbf{Infographic plastic pollution} (ROUTLEY

How long does plastic remain in the ocean? (Gr?n
\protect\hyperlink{ref-plastic_pollution_visualizations}{2016})

Overall, this visualization is useful in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It provides content: those plots serve one of the primary purposes of
  data visualization - storytelling. It naturally leads the audience to
  understand the effects of plastic pollution.
\item
  Effective use of charts: the correct use of different types of plots
  makes the visualization both effective and exciting.
\item
  Efficient use of color: this visualization is a good example of color
  playing an essential role in a data visualization by guiding the
  reader to grasp the relationships in the data. There is no redundant
  color, and no primary color is missing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Language}\label{language}

\subsection{Green Honey}\label{green-honey}

The visualization spans a webpage (Lee
\protect\hyperlink{ref-green_honey}{2016}) referenced in (Kayla Darling
\protect\hyperlink{ref-cool_data}{2017}). As you scroll down, the text
changes, as do many colored dots that move over the white background.
The dots are used to represent not only each colors' hue but the numbers
that fall into each category --- for example, what colors are the most
famous ``base'' colors for English and Chinese. The continuous flow of
this visualization helps bring it together, allowing users to scroll
through the information at their own pace, but also creating a seamless,
creative work.

\subsection{Linguistic Concepts}\label{linguistic-concepts}

This case study is about the use of linguistic concepts; it discusses
how the data is being used and how visual graphics are used to deliver
the central insights. It presents an educational tool that integrates
computational linguistics resources for use in non-technical
undergraduate language science courses. By using the tool in conjunction
with case studies, it provides opportunities for students to gain an
understanding of linguistic concepts and analysis through the lens of
realistic problems in feasible ways (Alm, Meyers, and Prud'hommeaux
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lingui_data}{2017}).

HistoBankVis is a novel visualization system designed for the
interactive analysis of complex, multidimensional data to facilitate
historical linguistic work (Michael Hund
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lingui_data1}{2015}). In this paper, the
visualization's efficacy and power are illustrated utilizing a concrete
case study investigating the diachronic interaction of word order and
subject case in Icelandic.

Much of what computational linguists fall back upon to improve natural
language processing and model language ``understanding'' is the
structure that has, at best, only an indirect attestation in observable
data. The sheer complexity of these structuresl and the observable
patterns on which they are based, however, usually limit their
accessibility, often even to the researchers creating or studying them.
Traditional statistical graphs and custom-designed data illustrations
fill the pages of CL papers, providing insight into linguistic and
algorithmic structures, but visual `externalizations' such as these are
almost exclusively used in CL for presentation and explanation. There
are particular statistical methods, falling under the rubric of
``exploratory data analysis,'' and visualization techniques just for
this purpose are available. However, these are not widely used. These
novel data visualization techniques offer the potential for creating new
methods that reveal structure and detail in data. Visualization can
provide new methods for interacting with large corpora, complex
linguistic structures, and can lead to a better understanding of the
states of stochastic processes.

\subsection{State of the Union 2014 Minute by Minute on
Twitter}\label{state-of-the-union-2014-minute-by-minute-on-twitter}

Twitter's data team assembled an impressive interactive data hub that
depicts how Twitter users across the globe reacted to each paragraph of
President Obama's 2014 State of the Union address (Belmonte
\protect\hyperlink{ref-SotU2014}{2014}). You can slice and dice the data
by topic hashtag (for example, \#budget, \#defense, or \#education) and
state, resulting in a powerful detailed and cluttered visualization.
Since the visualization is about the topic density in a specific time
frame, maybe it's a good idea for us to use this kind of format when we
encounter the expression of a poisson distribution.

\subsection{Connecting the Dots Behind the
Election}\label{connecting-the-dots-behind-the-election}

This article in the New York Times lists several different candidates
and creates compelling visuals that link their campaigns to previous
ones (Aisch and Yourish
\protect\hyperlink{ref-campaign_staff}{2015})(Kayla Darling
\protect\hyperlink{ref-cool_data}{2017}). Each visual contains several
different sized dots that represent a specific campaign, administration,
or other governmental organization related to the candidate's current
campaign, which is then connected by arrows. Hovering over a specific
dot highlights the connections between the groups. This visual is a
great way to summarize what would otherwise require a long slog through
years of information into an easily accessible and viewable format so
that voters can figure out where the candidates' experiences lie.

\subsection{A Guide to Who is Fighting Whom in
Syria}\label{a-guide-to-who-is-fighting-whom-in-syria}

One of the charts shown in the link (Crooks
\protect\hyperlink{ref-int_viz_capt}{2017}), the visualization of `A
Guide to Who is Fighting Whom in Syria' is an exciting graphic to study.
The visualization and its report can be seen at (Keating and Kirk
\protect\hyperlink{ref-syria_chart}{2015}).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Who is Fighting Whom in Syria}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Keating and Kirk \protect\hyperlink{ref-syria_chart}{2015}))

This visualization helps elucidate an extremely complicated topic like
the Syrian War. It consists of 3 different emojis in three different
colors, with each color and facial expression combination showing the
ties and conflicts between the various groups involved in the Syrian
War. When you click on each emoji, a small dialogue box pops up that
explains the relationships between the various countries and rebel
groups involved in the war. This is not only easy to understand but is
also pleasing to the eyes.

On the other hand, the inherent complexity of relationships between
different groups make it difficult to understand the complete picture.
If the list of involved parties could be sorted by simplified ``sides''
(such as Syrian Government on one end with Syrian Rebels on the other)
or ranked by how liked they are, then it may be easier for a trend to
emerge at first glance. Also, the table format of the visualization
means that the data is duplicated, making it appear even more
complicated. Instead, one side of the diagonal divide could be
greyed-out to simplify the audience's experience with this
visualization.

\subsection{Simpson's Paradox}\label{simpsons-paradox}

The Visualizing Urban Data Idealab (VUDlab) out of the University of
California-Berkeley put together this visual representation of data that
disproves the claim in a 1973 suit that charged the school with sex
discrimination. Though the graduate schools had accepted 44\% of male
applicants but only 35\% of female applicants, researchers later
uncovered that if the data were properly pooled, there was a small but
statistically significant bias in favor of women. This is called a
Simpson's Paradox.

By ``properly pooled,'' the investigators meant broken down by the
department. For instance, men were more inclined towards science and
women towards humanities. When compared to each other, the science
departments required more specialized skills while the humanities would
accept applicants with a more standard undergrad curriculum, thus
creating the Simpson's Paradox.

This interactive graph, built using a
\href{https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database\#.WxbaMVMvzq1}{database}
from the Union of Concerned Scientists, displays the trajectories of the
1,300 active satellites currently orbiting the Earth. Each satellite is
represented by a circular icon, color-coded by country and sized
according to launch mass (Yanofsky and Fernholz
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Satellite}{2015}).

Interactive graph have its own specific advantages. It helps bridge the
gap between programmers and non-programmers. This plot is a good example
why using interactive graph is a good idea: - It provides an intuitive
way for anyone to understand the data regardless of their technical
knowledge. - It helps to identifying causes and trends more quickly - It
tells a consistent story through data - It improves efficiency of
representing data

\subsection{Malaria}\label{malaria}

The authors of Vizwiz redesigned ``The Seasonality of Confirmed Malaria
Cases in Zambia Southern Province'' by pointing out what works well,
what could be improved, and why their new visualization will be better.

This chart above showed relation between health facilities and community
health worker in Malaria during years. From that chart we can see when
summer come cases of malaria increase and it showed a quite clear trend.
But through overlapping the two variables, health facilities and health
worker it is hard to see each trend. The better way to improve this is
use bar chart or line chart to shwo trend of each variable. Also the
color it use is quite dazzling and not comfortable, if the chart mean to
explain relation of summer temperature this may proper, however it is
health related maybe a cool color here is better. Original Version:
\includegraphics{images/malaria_original.png}

New Version: \includegraphics{images/malaria_makeover.png}

The original visualization effectively shows the seasonality of malaria
cases but is unclear if the two reporting categories are stacked or one
behind the other and is rather garish. The creator of the redesign made
the seasonality more obvious by combining the reporting categories and
explaining the spikes better.

Furthermore, by adding the yearly data split by districts, we can lead
to a possible actionable solution to the study of malaria cases in
Zambia which is an important objective of visualization. The author has
combined the data to find out what the data looks like when combined
with health facilities and health workers. And the usage of the color
scheme is much more effective than the previous version which makes
seasonality more evident.

\subsection{Is it Better to Rent or
Buy?}\label{is-it-better-to-rent-or-buy}

There are many factors involved in deciding to rent or buy a house which
has led to many calculators that are supposed to simplify this decision.
This calculator includes several sloping charts, each including a factor
that will affect how much you will have to pay, such as the individual
cost of your home and your mortgage rates (Bostock, Carter, and Tse
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rent_or_buy}{2014}). A movable scale along the
bottom of each chart allows you to enter different data, such as
changing the ``cost of rent per month'' on the side. This can be useful
for price comparison: if you can find a similar house to rent for that
much per month or less, it is more cost effective just to rent the home.
This visualization is incredibly thorough and a useful tool for
homeowners of any age and status.

\subsection{An Interactive Visualization of NYC Street
Trees}\label{an-interactive-visualization-of-nyc-street-trees}

Using data from NYC Open Data, this interactive visualization shows the
variety and quantity of street trees planted across the five New York
City boroughs (Zapata \protect\hyperlink{ref-trees}{2014}). As the
reader hovers over a tree or bar segment, the connected sections light
up, making it easier for the reader to look at what otherwise could have
been a very dense chart.

We can see what some of the familiar and uncommon trees planted in the
five boroughs of New York City are. This visualization allows one to see
the distribution quickly. One can make inferences based on the
distribution, such as trees in the Bronx and Manhattan seem to be
distributed more uniformly compared to the other three boroughs. It
gives a direct comparison between the five boroughs which could be used
to make a compelling decision by the audience.

\begin{figure}

The interactive visualization is an advantage that enables the display,
and intuitive understanding of multidimensional data provides a variety
of visualization chart types and enables the audience to accomplish
traditional data exploration tasks by making charts interactive.
Moreover, this visualization provides a good example: it enables the
audience to explore on their own and finds exciting facts about NYC
street trees.

\subsection{Adding up the White Oscars
Winners}\label{adding-up-the-white-oscars-winners}

A visualization of all previous winners of the Best Actor/Actress Oscar
winners can be seen in an article by Bloomberg (``Adding up the White
Oscar Winners'' \protect\hyperlink{ref-adding_oscars}{2016}). From the
attributes of past Oscars winners, the authors have developed a set of
attributes that they believe will continue to be prevalent in future
Oscar winners. It is fascinating to see how the article shows the
features of the Best Actress, Actor, movies, etc. in a simple and
captivating visual.

The visualization is interactive, and we can click on each attribute
like `Hair Color,' `Eye Color,' etc. to see the features of the actors
and actresses who are likely to win the Oscars. Based on different
attributes selected, the visualization changes to give you the data
specific to the attributes. For each attribute selected, it gives you a
fact about the selected attribute related to the Oscar Winner. For
instance, when you select the race, it states ``In the entire history of
the Oscars all but 8 of the Best Actors and Best Actresses have been
white''. Similarly, the visualization also gives information about the
different aspects of movies that are more likely to win, like `Length,'
`Month,' `Budget,' etc., and also predict about the future nominees who
are likely to win Oscar.

\subsection{Kissmetrics blog: visualization of
metrics}\label{kissmetrics-blog-visualization-of-metrics}

Kissmetrics blog is a place where people talk about analytics,
marketing, and testing through narratives and visualization of metrics.
Metrics are essential in the real world, especially when
developing/promoting products. Visualization of metrics is also
essential so that stakeholders can monitor performance, identify
problems and dive deep into potential issues.

This example from the Kissmetrics blog is about Facebook's organic reach
(Patel \protect\hyperlink{ref-facebook_organic}{2018}). One crucial
point discussed in the blog is whether the Facebook's organic reach is
decreasing drastically.

The general trend shows that there is a considerable decline in
Facebook's page organic reach.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/facebook-page-organic-reach-decline-over-years.jpg}

\subsection{Describe Artists with
Emoji}\label{describe-artists-with-emoji}

Using the data from Spotify, the author listed the ten most distinctive
emoji used in the playlists related to favorite artists (Insights

this visual is very straightforward to link the artist to the emojis and
is very easy to compare among artists. When you hover over the emoji,
further information is presented.

\subsection{Goldilocks Exoplanets}\label{goldilocks-exoplanets}

Using data from the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University
of Puerto Rico, the interactive graph on Astrobiology plots planetary
mass, atmospheric pressure, and temperature to determine what exoplanets
might be home, or have been home at one point, to living beings (Tomanio
and Gonzalez Veira \protect\hyperlink{ref-goldilocks_worlds}{2014}).

One highlight of the graph is how color has been used. The red dots
represent planets that are too hot, the blue dots mean too cold, and the
green ones mean just the right temperature. This is very intuitive for
people to understand without the necessity to read through the notes.
The dots are semi-transparent so the overlapping of planets does not
detract from the audience's ability to read the graph.

Additionally, the size of each dot represents the radius of each planet.
At first glance, one might assume that most planets are much larger than
Eath, but the visualization includes a note explaining that larger
planets are easier to find. This is a good example of how much
explanation to include in a visualization, not so much that the audience
is distracted from the graph but enough that they have the information
needed to interpret it.

\subsection{Visualization of big data security: a case study on the
KDD99 cup data
set}\label{visualization-of-big-data-security-a-case-study-on-the-kdd99-cup-data-set}

This paper utilized a visualization algorithm together with significant
data analysis to gain better insights into the KDD99 dataset:

\textbf{Abstract}\\
Cybersecurity has been thrust into the limelight in the modern
technological era because of an array of attacks often bypassing new
intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Therefore, deciphering better
methods for identifying attack types to train IDSs more effectively has
become a field of great interest. Critical cyber-attack insights exist
in big data; however, an efficient approach is required to determine
strong attack types to train IDSs to become more active in critical
areas. Despite the rising growth in IDS research, there is a lack of
studies involving big data visualization, which is crucial. The KDD99
dataset has served as a reliable benchmark since 1999; therefore, this
dataset was utilized in the experiment. This study utilized a hash
algorithm, a weight table, and sampling method to deal with the inherent
problems caused by analyzing big data: volume, variety, and velocity. By
utilizing a visualization algorithm, the researchers were able to gain
insights into the KDD99 dataset with precise identification of
``normal'' clusters and described distinct clusters of possible attacks.

\section{Outlier Detection}\label{outlier-detection}

(Arribas-Gil and Romo \protect\hyperlink{ref-outliar}{2014})

We can use data visualization for outlier detection in a data set.
Different methods for outlier detection in functional data have been
developed over the years. Several of these methods rely on different
notions of functional depth, robust principal components, or random
projections of infinite-dimensional data into R. Some distributional
approaches have also been considered (Gervini, 2009). In functional data
analysis, we observe curves defined over a given real interval and shape
outliers may be defined as those curves that exhibit a different shape
from the rest of the sample. Other types of outliers include:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Outlier\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.77\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Description\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Global Outliers (or ``point anomalies'')\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.77\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A data point is considered a global outlier if its value is far outside
the entirety of the data set in which it is found.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Contextual (Conditional) Outliers\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.77\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A data point is considered a contextual outlier if its value
significantly deviates from the rest of the data points in the same
context. Note that this means that the same value may not be considered
an outlier if it occurred in a different context. If we limit our
discussion to time series data, the ``context'' is almost always
temporal, because time series data are records of a specific quantity
over time. Contextual outliers are common in time series data.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Collective outliers\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.77\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
A subset of data points within a data set is considered anomalous if
those values as a collection deviate significantly from the entire data
set, but the values of the individual data points are not themselves
anomalous in either a contextual or global sense. In time series data,
one way this can manifest is as normal peaks and valleys occurring
outside of a time frame when that seasonal sequence is normal or as a
combination of time series data that is in an outlier as a group.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Below is a simple example. Outlier treatment is important because it can
drastically bias/change the fit estimates and predictions.

\section{Tips to Improve Data
Visualization}\label{tips-to-improve-data-visualization}

(French \protect\hyperlink{ref-French}{2017}), (Steier et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Steier}{2012})

\subsection{Comparison}\label{comparison-1}

Include a zero baseline if possible. Although a line chart does not have
to start at a zero baseline, it should be included if it gives more
context for comparison. If relatively small fluctuations in data are
meaningful (e.g., in stock market data), you may truncate the scale to
showcase these variances. Always choose the most efficient
visualization. Watch your placement - You may have two nice stacked bar
charts that are meant to let your reader compare points, but if they're
placed too far apart to ``get'' the comparison, you've already lost.
Tell the whole story. Maybe you had a 30\% sales increase in Q4.
Exciting! But what's more exciting? Showing that you've actually had a
100\% sales increase since Q1.

\subsection{Copy}\label{copy}

Don't over explain if the copy already mentions a fact. The subhead,
callout, and chart header don't have to reiterate it. Keep the chart and
graph headers simple and to the point. There's no need to get clever,
verbose, or puntastic. Keep any descriptive text above the chart brief
and directly related to the chart underneath. Remember: Focus on the
quickest path to comprehension. Use callouts wisely. Callouts are not
there to fill space. They should be used intentionally to highlight
relevant information or provide additional context. Don't use
distracting fonts or elements. Sometimes you do need to emphasize a
point. If so, only use bold or italic text to emphasize a point --- and
don't use them both at the same time.

\subsection{Color}\label{color}

Use a single color to represent the same type of data. Watch out for
positive and negative numbers. Don't use red for positive numbers or
green for negative numbers. Those color associations are so strong it
will automatically flip the meaning in the viewer's mind. Make sure
there is sufficient contrast between colors. Avoid patterns. Stripes and
polka dots sound fun, but they can be incredibly distracting. If you are
trying to differentiate, say, on a map, use different saturation of the
same color. On that note, only use solid-colored lines (not dashes).
Select colors appropriately. Don't use more than 6 colors in a single
layout.

\subsection{Ordering}\label{ordering}

Order data intuitively. There should be a logical hierarchy. Order
categories alphabetically, sequentially, or by value. Order
consistently. Order evenly. Use natural increments on your axes (0, 5,
10, 15, 20) instead of awkward or uneven increments (0, 3, 5, 16, 50).

\subsection{Audience Perspective}\label{audience-perspective}

Let the users lead. Know your audience. Designers should consider the
way users prefer to understand the information, even in choosing basic
analytic approaches. For users to feel comfortable adopting and sharing
insights from analytics, they must be able to explain and defend the
data.

\subsection{Use Layers to Tell a
Story}\label{use-layers-to-tell-a-story}

While style is one form of customization, layering unique data sets on a
single visualization can tell a richer narrative and connect users to
the data without getting too crowded. On a map, this can be as simple as
zooming in and out, but it can also involve drill-downs (choosing a data
point and expanding it to show more detail), links and other shortcuts.

\subsection{Keep It Simple}\label{keep-it-simple}

Analytic results shouldn't be presented to 10 decimal places when the
user doesn't need that level of precision to make a decision or
understand a concept. Effective visual interfaces avoid 3-D effects or
ornate gauge designs (a.k.a. ``chart junk'') when simple numbers, maps
or graphs will suffice.

\section{Charts}\label{charts}

\subsection{What makes a chart
effective?}\label{what-makes-a-chart-effective}

Data visualization is a combination of art and science. When it comes to
the artistic aspect, there are no correct answers for doing the
visualization. There are many ways to present the data. However, when
making sense of facts, numbers, and measurements, a better understanding
and effectiveness is promoted by a logical path to follow. To determine
the best type of chart is hard for those new to data visualization. Most
people learn it by referring to other people's work without
understanding the underlying logic, so they don't have the theory in
their mind to make the judgment.

Therefore, before we begin visualizing our data, we need to start with
the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Know the purpose}{[}@ chart\_purpose{]} - (Analytical or
  Presentation)(Ref-\url{https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/Kosara-C4PGV-2016.pdf}):
  It is important to know the purpose of designing a visualization. In
  many cases, it is designed to explore or analyze data to enable
  readers to find insights in data themselves. But there are also cases
  when its purpose is to present and create awareness about certain
  findings or even to make a decision. For example, when a journalist
  creates a visualization for reporting on the current weather
  situation, the goal there is to mainly present the key trends and
  create awareness among the general public. When climate scientists
  create visualizations for communicating their results to policy makers
  on climate change, they are mainly calling for actions.
\item
  \textbf{Know your audience}{[}@ chart\_audience{]}: After we know the
  why we are designing a visualization, it is important to know who are
  we targeting with that visual. No matter who your intended audience
  is, it is important to customize it to their needs, interest, level of
  expertise and analytical ability. Certain factors like their cultural
  preferences, expertise level, etc., also play a key role in designing
  an effective visualization. For eg., colors have a special
  significance in Chinese culture. They use red to represent a dynamic
  or/and a positive event, such as growing sales in a region, while in
  most of the western world blue or green represents positive trends,
  such as sales revenue, etc. Similarly, a visualization designed for a
  finance analyst will be different from a visual designed for a
  marketing manager. Therefore, customization is key in ensuring
  effectiveness of a visualization.
\item
  \textbf{Know the right chart type}{[}@ chart\_audience{]}: Once you
  know the purpose and have identified the target audience, it is
  important to choose the right chart type. Choosing the right visual,
  which could be a chart, map, table, dashboard or infographic, ensures
  that it resonates well with your audience. Also, it empowers the
  readers to explore the data, identify insights and make decisions
  after evaluating different scenarios.
\end{itemize}

After answering these questions, you should be able to get a better
image of your ideal graph. The simple guidance for using the different
types of the chart is - line charts for tracking trends over time, bar
charts to compare quantities, scatter plots for a joint variation of two
data items, bubble charts showing the joint variation of three data
items, and pie charts to compare parts of a whole. However, let's delve
deeper into the various presentation styles and types of common charts.

\subsection{Chart Types}\label{chart-types}

(Catalogue \protect\hyperlink{ref-charts_viz}{2018})\\
This is a survey of the most commonly used chart types, best use cases
for each, and pros and cons of each.

\subsection{Temporal Visualizations}\label{temporal-visualizations}

(Ayalasomayajula NA)\\
What are some of the most common data visualizations seen in newspapers,
textbooks, and corporate annual reports? Graphs showing a country's GDP
growth trends or charts capturing a company's sales growth in the last 4
quarters would be high up on the list. \textbf{Essentially, these are
visualizations that track time series data -- the performance of an
indicator over a period of time -- also known as temporal
visualizations.}

Temporal visualizations are one of the simplest and quickest ways to
represent important time series data. There are 7 handy temporal
visualization styles for your time series data.

\subsection{Line Graph}\label{line-graph}

A line graph is the simplest way to represent time series data. It is
intuitive, easy to create, and helps the viewer get a quick sense of how
something has changed over time.

\subsection{Stacked Area Chart}\label{stacked-area-chart}

Stacked area charts are area charts similar to a line chart. In an area
chart, multiple variables are ``stacked'' on top of each other, and the
area below each line is colored to represent each variable. Stacked area
charts are useful to show how both a cumulative total and individual
components of that total changed over time. The order in which we stack
the variables is crucial because sometimes, there can be a difference in
the actual plot versus the human perception.

The figure below is a stacked area chart showing time series data:
\includegraphics{images/aya-stacked.png}

(Source: (Ayalasomayajula NA))

\subsection{Bar Charts}\label{bar-charts}

Bar charts represent data as horizontal or vertical bars. The length of
each bar is proportional to the value of the variable at that point in
time. A bar chart is the right choice when you wish to look at how the
variable moved over time or when you wish to compare the variable with
each other. Grouped or stacked bar charts help you combine both these
purposes in one chart while keeping your visualization simple and
intuitive. The chart plots the value vertically whereas we perceive the
value to be at right angles to the general direction of the chart.

In the figure below, a bar graph would be a cleaner alternative.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/aya-stacked-perception.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source: (Ayalasomayajula NA))

For instance, the grouped bar chart in this interactive visualization of
number of deaths by disease type in India not only lets you compare the
deaths due to diarrhea, malaria, and acute respiratory disease across
time, but also lets you compare the number of deaths by these three
diseases in a given year. By switching to the stacked bar chart view,
you get an intuitive sense of the proportion of deaths caused by each
disease. We can use two different bar charts to represent time series
data.

\subsection{Column Charts for Time Series
Data}\label{column-charts-for-time-series-data}

This should be the most popular chart type. This chart is good to do a
comparison between different values when specific values are important.

Still have hard time to choose? There are many resources online which
can help you make the decision. For example, Dr.~Andre Abela creates a
chart selection diagram that is helpful to pick the right chart
depending on the data type. The link of website is{]}**

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

(Source: (Ayalasomayajula NA))

To avoid clutter and confusion, make sure not to use more than 3
variables in a stacked or group bar chart. It is also a good practice to
use consistent bold colors and leave appropriate space between two bars
in a bar chart.

\subsection{Gantt Chart}\label{gantt-chart}

\textbf{Gantt charts are a popular project management tool since they
present a concise snapshot of various tasks spread across various phases
of the project.} A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart showing work
completed in a certain period of time with respect to the time allocated
for that particular task. It is named after the American engineer and
management consultant Henry Gantt who extensively used this framework
for project management. You can show additional information such as the
correlation between individual tasks, resources used in each task,
overlapping resources, etc. by the use of colors and placement of bars
in a Gantt chart.

The planning of logistics for a dance concert presents a situation in
which a Gantt chart is a good option. There are many activities to be
completed, some of which will take place simultaneously while some can
only be done sequentially. For instance, the choreographers, soundtrack,
and dancers need to be finalized before the choreography can begin.
However, the costumes, props, and stage decor can be planned at the same
time as the choreography. With careful preparation, Gantt charts can
help you plan for complex, long-term projects that are likely to undergo
several revisions and have various resource and task dependencies.

Gantt charts are a popular project management tool since they present a

\subsection{Stream Graph}\label{stream-graph}

\textbf{Stream graphs are great to represent and compare time series
data for multiple variables.} Stream graphs are, thus, apt for large
data sets. Remember that choice of colors is very important, especially
when there are lots of variables. Variables that do not have
significantly high values might tend to get drowned out in the
visualization if the colors are not chosen well.

displaced around a central horizontal axis. The stream graph looks like
flowing liquid, hence the name. They are great to represent and compare

\subsection{Heat Map}\label{heat-map}

\textbf{Heat maps are perfect for a two-tiered time frame} -- for
instance, 7 days of the week spread across 52 weeks in the year, or 24
hours in a day spread across 30 days of the month, and so on. The
limitation, though, is that only one variable can be visualized in a
heat map. Comparison between two or more variables is very difficult to
represent in a heat map.

Geo-spatial visualizations often use heat maps since they quickly help
identify ``hot spots'' or regions of high concentrations of a given
variable. When adapted to temporal visualizations, heat maps can help us
explore two levels of time in a 2D array.

This heat map visualizes birthdays of babies born in the United States
between 1973 and 1999. The vertical axis represents the 31 days in a
month while the horizontal axis represents the 12 months in a year. This
chart quickly helps us identify that a large number of babies were born
in the latter half of July, August, and September.

\subsection{Polar Area Diagram}\label{polar-area-diagram}

Think beyond the straight line! Sometimes, time series data can be
cyclical -- a season in a year, time of the day, and so on. Polar area
diagrams help represent the cyclical nature time series data cleanly. A
polar diagram looks like a traditional pie chart, but the sectors differ
from each other not by the size of their angles but by how far they
extend out from the center of the circle.

\textbf{Polar area diagrams are useful for representing seasonal or
cyclical time series data, such as climate or seasonal crop data.
Multiple variables can be neatly stacked in the various sectors of the
pie.}

It is crucial to clarify whether the variable is proportional to the
area or radius of the sector. It is a good practice to have the area of
the sectors proportional to the value being represented. In that case,
the radius should be proportional to the square root of the value of the
variable (since the area of a circle is proportional to the square of
the radius).

This popular polar area diagram created by Florence Nightingale shows
causes of mortality among British troops in the Crimean War. Each color
in the diagram represents a different cause of death. (Check out the
text legend for more details.)

\subsection{Time Series Data and Its Deceptive
Potential}\label{time-series-data-and-its-deceptive-potential}

(``Avoiding Common Mistakes with Time Series''
\protect\hyperlink{ref-TimeSeries}{2015})

This article explains how time series data visualization can sometimes
be deceptive.

It first takes an example of two random time series data and plots them
on a graph which gives an impression that the two are strongly
correlated. But if we do some statistical testing, the two do not show
any relationship, this is an example of \textbf{``correlation does not
necessarily mean causation''}.

In another set of examples, the author has taken trending two random
time series data and shown how even statistical tests can give a wrong
interpretation. The article then explains using visualization how a
general trended time series can be different than a more controlled and
measured trending time series.

\subsection{Pie Chart and Why Pie Charts are Bad: a Comparison with the
Bar
Chart}\label{pie-chart-and-why-pie-charts-are-bad-a-comparison-with-the-bar-chart}

(Quach \protect\hyperlink{ref-quach-penny}{2016})

Using a pie chart is usually considered as a bad idea when it comes to
data visualization. Here, we explore some cons of using the pie chart to
convey information and compare its effectiveness to the bar chart.

\textbf{1.} Some information may be difficult to distinguish in a pie
chart; however, if the data is presented with bar charts, differences in
the data presented may be more obvious.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/hickey-before.jpg}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/hickey-after.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source: (Hickey \protect\hyperlink{ref-hickey-pie-worst}{2013}))

\textbf{2.} It is difficult to compare the slices of a circle to figure
out the distinctions in size between each pie slice, especially when
there are many categories.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/hickey-breakdown.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source: (Hickey \protect\hyperlink{ref-hickey-pie-worst}{2013}))

\textbf{3.} A pie chart is easily manipulated (e.g.~using a 3D pie
chart).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/hickey-3D.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source: (Hickey \protect\hyperlink{ref-hickey-pie-worst}{2013}))

\textbf{4.} A pie chart may be useful when comparing two different
categories with different amounts of information. Specifically, it does
a better job to distinguish two parts with a 25:75 split or one that is
not 50:50 as people are sensitive to a right angle or a dividing line
that is not straight. However, this could be done more simply by showing
two numbers!

\section{Maps}\label{maps}

\textbf{Use Maps Only When Effective}\\
(Bradshaw \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bradshaw}{2015})\\
Maps are a popular choice when it comes to displaying geographical data;
they are more exciting and engaging than a simple bar or line chart but
still easy to comprehend. Maps are attention-grabbing, so at the first
glance they seem like a great option.

However, just because the data can be represented on a map does not mean
that it should be. When used properly, a map can be an excellent choice
for illustrating a story. However, if geographic information is not
relevant to convey the desired message, then a visualizing your data
using a map is actually counterproductive. As with any visual, maps are
not a universal solution simply because they are eye-catching.

One good use of a map is to show points or specific locations. This use
of a map can show how points are distributed and reveal patterns, for
example, certain areas having more high-end restaurants. This is not the
right approach if the geographic information does not tell a story. If
the story is more about comparing data such as median salary, a map is
not the most effective. Caution should also be exercised with map
visualizations if there are too many points and the data blurs together,
causing the data to lose its meaning.

Encoding the data is another potential area for confusion. The most
popular methods are using color, shape, and size. Again, each of these
can be effective when done properly, but many people misuse them. Using
too many colors can make the chart harder to interpret. If necessary,
data can be grouped into categories such as good and bad or high, medium
and low. Shapes should be easily distinguished, so there shouldn't be
too many unique ones. Also, if the use of shapes does not significantly
add to the story, it is probably best to remove them. The size of a
marker is a clear way to describe amounts but can easily become a
problem if there are outliers. Locations with large values could obscure
other data points. The best practice is to use just one of these methods
rather than combining two or more.

Use of maps can be tricky. Geographical data doesn't imply that a map is
the best choice to represent it. Maps can be useful for application
where proximity matters, but for straight ``what is higher'' type
comparisons, they're not very effective since large regions will draw
more attention than smaller regions due to more concentrated color.

\section{Choosing the Right Baseline in Data
Visualization}\label{choosing-the-right-baseline-in-data-visualization}

(Yau \protect\hyperlink{ref-baseline_2013}{2013})

The baseline is very important to data visualization. If the baseline is
different, the appearance of the data may change drastically. Here is a
case study to show the importance of baseline:

use. Different baselines will lead to totally different graphs.

\section{Using Design Patterns to Find Greater Meaning in Your
Data}\label{using-design-patterns-to-find-greater-meaning-in-your-data}

(Julie Rodriguez \protect\hyperlink{ref-greater}{2016})

Visualizations that show comparisons, connections, and conclusions offer
analytical clarity.

Patterns based on function can help you see differences and similarities
more clearly, understand relationships and behaviors more intimately,
and predict future results with a greater level of certainty. When these
patterns are presented as visualizations, they help you - 1) see
comparisons, 2) make connections, and 3) draw conclusions from your data
sets. The major functions can be described with the following examples:

\subsection{Comparisons}\label{comparisons}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/patten-1.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure 1, the bar chart with sparkline enables you to review
the data at two different levels: a high-level assessment of the
short-term three-month returns is represented with the bar chart, while
the sparkline (the line chart below the bar) provides the details of the
historical returns. Quickly and concisely, the sparkline shows you the
path that has led up to the most recent returns. You can then assess
that a narrow path provides consistent returns across the years while a
wide path provides varied returns. Side-by-side comparisons of funds
organized into two columns---\% Returns and \% Ahead of
Benchmark---enables peer comparisons and fund-specific benchmark
comparisons. Hence, you can see that not only has Global Large-Cap Core
provided positive returns, it has also provided the best and most
consistent returns when compared to the benchmark.

\subsection{Connections}\label{connections}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/pattern-2.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The string of charts in Figure 2 shows 10-year to year-to-date (YTD)
performance returns, which can be interpreted as individual charts or a
group of category charts.

Similar to sounds waves, the symmetrical area charts grow equidistant
from the source (the zero line) at each time interval to accentuate the
returns even further. Here, the y-axis is shown in percentage. Instead
of using the zero line to indicate positive or negative returns, it uses
color to denote if the category returns are positive (black) or negative
(red). For example, Multi-Cap Russell 3000 Growth produced 20\% positive
returns within the one-year time period and is shown with color fill in
both directions from the zero line to purposefully duplicate the large
gains and specifically uses black color fill to indicate the returns are
positive. As evident from the name, the symmetrical chart doubles the
returns to emphasize the amount of color fill.

What else can we derive from organizing the information in a spectrum of
negative to positive returns? Based on this organization, three groups
of categories have resulted in straight losses (red), heavy gains
(black), or a mix of gains and losses across a decade of returns. The
string of charts makes it easier to see these three groups of categories
to assess their distribution. Just like sound waves, each chart is a
sound bite that streams the returns for each category with a ``scream''
announcing a huge gain (e.g., Multi-Cap Russel 3000 Growth) or loss
(e.g., Mid-Cap Russel Mid Cap Growth). In some cases (e.g., Large Cap
S\&P 500), the chart quietly announces mixed returns to adequately
demand less attention.

Next, we might wonder how we would have fared if we had invested in
certain funds. We might ask: if we had purchased this fund five years
ago, what would the return be? And what about the YTD returns? Since
market timing is key to investment choices, the following presentation
of hypothetical investments represents a range of results.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/pattern-3.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

In Figure 3, varied performance results become clear with a layered
approach to show five potential entry points (10-year, 5-year, 3-year,
1-year, YTD) into an investment. For example, the International Large
Cap Core fund provided 27\% YTD returns, which contrast the negative
returns you would have received had you invested in the fund 1, 5, or 10
years ago. Here, conclusions are derived based on known inputs with a
divided review of positive or negative outcomes (shown on the y-axis).

The line weights help to identify each entry point and show the range of
differences between the entry points. Accordingly so, resulting returns
are shown with simplified curves that connect the inputs and outputs. In
this case, the chart has been customized to show an instance in which
the user has opted to see the YTD return values as percentages listed to
the right of each resulting output.

\section{Takeaways From Recreating One Chart Using 24
Tools}\label{takeaways-from-recreating-one-chart-using-24-tools}

(Rost \protect\hyperlink{ref-different_tools}{2016})

Lisa Rost's article ``What I learned recreating one chart using 24
tools'' describes lessons learned from recreating one chart using many
different data visualization tools. The author used apps Excel, Plotly,
Easycharts, Google Sheets, Lyra, Highcharts, Tableau, Polestar,
Quadrigram, Illustrator, RAW, and NodeBox, as well as charting libraries
ggvis, Bokeh, Highcharts, ggplot2, Processing, NVD3, Seaborn, Vega, D3,
matplotlib, Vega-Lite, and R. She links her GitHub page on the project
which details the data set she used, containing the health expectancy in
years as well as GDP per capita and population for about 200 countries
in the year 2015, as well as her process and results of visualizing the
data using each tool. However, in the article, she focuses on the main
takeaways from the exercise, which was especially interesting in the
context of our class discussion on different types of tools and their
respective strengths. She also provides her own graphics to help
illustrate her lessons learned.

\subsection{Takeaway 1: There is No Perfect Tool, Just Good Tools for
People with Certain
Goals}\label{takeaway-1-there-is-no-perfect-tool-just-good-tools-for-people-with-certain-goals}

Since data visualization is used in a wide variety of fields, from
science to journalism, data visualization projects will often have
differing objectives, as the people working on them will have different
requirements. As the author aptly points out, it is impossible for one
tool to satisfy the need of every data visualizer. Each tool has its own
pros and cons and it is up to the author in decided which is better
suited to meet his/her's specific situation. Hence, when deciding on a
tool or tools to use, one should always consider the purpose of the
visualization. For example, consider if the visualization is to show
exploratory data analysis or to be presented as a finding to the general
public or a specific audience.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/analysis_spectrum.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Rost \protect\hyperlink{ref-different_tools}{2016}))

The author also notes that the flexibility of a tool is a sticking point
as well if you need to change your data while developing a data
visualization, as certain apps like Illustrator will not be ideal
because changing the data even slightly requires you to build the graph
again from scratch. Another thing to think about is the type of chart
you are trying to create. Is a basic bar or line graph sufficient (in
which case something like Excel will do the trick), or does your project
require a more innovative or custom chart (using D3.js)? While
interactivity is a plus point, relevancy of the visualization is more
important.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/interactivity.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Rost \protect\hyperlink{ref-different_tools}{2016}))

\subsection{Takeaway 2: There Are No Perfect Tools, Just Good Tools for
People with Certain
Mindsets}\label{takeaway-2-there-are-no-perfect-tools-just-good-tools-for-people-with-certain-mindsets}

This section of the article is all about the difference in people's
preferences and opinions; from the people who build the tools to the
users, everyone thinks differently. Therefore, certain tools will be
inherently more intuitive to use for different people.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Takeaway 3: We Still Live in an `Apps Are
for the Easy Stuff, Code Is for the Good Stuff in the
World'}{Takeaway 3: We Still Live in an Apps Are for the Easy Stuff, Code Is for the Good Stuff in the World}}\label{takeaway-3-we-still-live-in-an-apps-are-for-the-easy-stuff-code-is-for-the-good-stuff-in-the-world}

Basically, writing code can be scary for anyone without a coding
background, but it provides more flexibility, and, as mentioned in
class, the code is perfectly reproducible. On the other hand, apps are
much more user-friendly for the less computer science-savvy.

\subsection{Takeaway 4: Every Tool Forces You Down a
Path}\label{takeaway-4-every-tool-forces-you-down-a-path}

Rost quotes her former NPR Visuals teammate for the final lesson header,
pointing out that tools themselves influence the development of a data
visualization with their respective features, strengths, and
limitations.

\section{Word Cloud}\label{word-cloud}

(McKee \protect\hyperlink{ref-wordcloud}{2014})

A Word Cloud or Tag Cloud is a visual representation of text data in the
form of tags, which are typically single words whose importance is
visualized by way of their size and color. It displays how frequently
words appear in a given body of text, by making the size of each word
proportional to its frequency.

Word clouds can add clarity to text analysis in order to effectively
communicate your data results.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Ways to generate a word cloud}

\textbf{R:} (analysis \protect\hyperlink{ref-r}{2018})\\
Creating word clouds is very simple in R with the text mining package
(TM) and the word cloud generator package. The major steps involved are:
text mining which involves text cleaning and transformation, building
term-document matrix and generating word cloud.

\textbf{Python:} Source (www.geeksforgeeks.org/) For generating word
cloud in Python, modules needed are -- matplotlib, pandas and wordcloud.
By using a mask, you can generate wordclouds in arbitrary shapes. You
can color a word-cloud by using an image-based coloring strategy
implemented in ImageColorGenerator. It uses the average color of the
region occupied by the word in a source image. You can combine this with
masking - pure-white will be interpreted as `don't occupy' by the
WordCloud object when passed as mask. If you want white as a legal
color, you can just pass a different image to ``mask'', but make sure
the image shapes line up. You can also use the recolor method and custom
coloring functions.

\textbf{Wordle:} (Feinberg \protect\hyperlink{ref-wordle}{2014}) Wordle
is a toy for generating ``word clouds'' from the text that you provide.
It is free and easy to use. You do need Java through Chrome. In Wordle,
you generate word clouds from text you give as input. Clouds can be
tweaked with different color schemes, layouts, and fonts. Images created
from this tool can be saved and reused (Feinberg
\protect\hyperlink{ref-wordle}{2014}).

Other popular tools include ABCya, Tagul, Tag Crowd and CloudArt.

\section{Dashboards}\label{dashboards}

(Taylor \protect\hyperlink{ref-intuitive_dash}{2018}),(tableau, n.d.)

(Few \protect\hyperlink{ref-dashboard}{2007}) \textgreater{} ``A
dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed
to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single
screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.'' -Stephen Few

\subsection{Rules and Best Practices for Developing Intuitive
Dashboards}\label{rules-and-best-practices-for-developing-intuitive-dashboards}

Often, data visuals end up too intricate and overly complicated. A
dashboard should be appealing but also easy to understand. Following
these rules will lead to the effective presentation of the data.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Best Practice\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Description\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{The dashboard should read left to right}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Because we read from top to bottom and left to right, a reader's eyes
will naturally look in the upper left of a page. The content should
therefore flow like words in a book. It is important to note that the
information at the top of the page does not always have to be the most
important. Annual data is usually more important to a business but daily
or weekly data could be used more often for day to day work. This should
be kept in mind when designing a dashboard since dashboards are often
used as a quick convenient way to look up data.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Group related information together}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Grouping related data together is an intuitive way to help the flow of
the visual. It does not make sense for a user to have to search in
different areas to find the information they need.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Find relationships between seemingly unrelated areas and display
visuals together to show the relationship.}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Grouping unrelated data seems contradictory to the second rule, but the
important thing is to tell a story not previously observed. Data
analytics is all about finding stories the data are trying to tell. Once
they are discovered, the stories need to be presented in an effective
manner. Grouping unrelated data together makes it easier to see how they
change together.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Choose metrics based on why they matter}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Chosen metrics should be important and relevant to the current task.
That doesn't mean that each metric ought to be incorporated. You ought
to be highly selective in determining which metrics earn a spot on your
dashboard. Organization's core objectives, availability of data that can
shed light on the objectives, effectiveness of metric to explain
contribution to the objectives etc. are some of the aspects to consider
while choosing metrics. In short, every metric on your dashboard should
connect to the organization objectives.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Keep it visual}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Dashboards are meant to be fast and easy to read. A well-designed,
highly visual dashboard will be more widely adopted by audiences. Since
metrics are also chosen in line with corporate objective, it will help
in speeding peoples' understanding. This will also help see the
translation of individual department objectives into broader
organizations objective.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Make it interactive}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Interactive, highly visual dashboards should enable audience to perform
basic analytical tasks, such as filtering the views, drilling down,
examining underlying data etc. Viewers should be able to get the big
picture from the dashboard and then be able to drill down into a view
that tells them the information they need to get their jobs done.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Keep it current or don't bother}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Selected metrics should reflect current business challenges. You don't
need up-to-the-minute data. Data can be current quarterly, weekly,
hourly, etc. as relevant to the timeline of the organization. Ability to
change and update the metrics represented in the dashboard is an
important aspect.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.17\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
\textbf{Make it simple to access and use}\strut
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\columnwidth}\raggedright\strut
Making dashboards easily accessible is critical. Web distribution is
ideal for this - especially if dashboards can constantly pull current
data and can adhere to IT protocols and security standards. Another
alternative is posting files on websites, Wiki's or blogs.\strut

\subsection{Using Shapes as Filters in Tableau When Your Fields Are
Measures}\label{using-shapes-as-filters-in-tableau-when-your-fields-are-measures}

(Brett \protect\hyperlink{ref-measures}{2018})\\
This article (Brett \protect\hyperlink{ref-measures}{2018}) introduces
the methodologies on how to use shapes as filters in Tableau when your
fields are measures. It teaches you how to load custom shapes as action
filters and use them for showing different graphs with those filters,
which can make your visualization more interesting and interactive. You
can also download the Tableau file for practice.

\subsection{How to Customize a Legend in Python with
Matplotlib}\label{how-to-customize-a-legend-in-python-with-matplotlib}

(Jake \protect\hyperlink{ref-PythonDataScienceHandbook}{2016}) A legend
shows descriptive labels and their respective colors or shapes for each
plotted data series. A good legend helps us to better understand the
graph and what each series represents.

\subsubsection{Add a Basic Legend}\label{add-a-basic-legend}

First, we need to import the matplotlib library in Python. Then we use
the legend() function to add a basic legend. For example, if we already
have a line graph with multiple lines, we can add a legend to
distinguish them from each other with the ax.legend() function, as shown
below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\NormalTok{ax.axis(}\StringTok{'equal'}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

\caption{}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Add a Legend on Different
Position}\label{add-a-legend-on-different-position}

To specify the position of the legend, the `loc' parameter inside the
function can be used:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ax.legend(loc}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'upper left'}\NormalTok{, frameon}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{False}\NormalTok{)}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Customize a Box Surrounding the
Legend}\label{customize-a-box-surrounding-the-legend}

We can also specify whether we want a box surrounding the legend with
the `fancybox' parameter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ax.legend(fancybox}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{, framealpha}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, shadow}\OperatorTok{=}\VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{, borderpad}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}

\includegraphics{images/legend5.png} \#\#How to customize a legend in
MATLAB Legend creates a legend with descriptive labels for each plotted
data series. A good legend helps us to better understand the graph. For
instance, we can accurately tell the meaning for a line of a plot or we
can understand the extented range for certain colors from a legend.
Without a legend, everything can be confusing for the readers. I would
like to introduce some basic methods of customizing a legend.

\textbf{Add a basic legend} First, we use the legend() function to add a
basic legend. For example, say we already have a line graph and there
are several lines on that plot. We can simply add a legend to
distinguish them from each other by using the ax.legend() function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{<!DOCTYPE }\NormalTok{html}\DataTypeTok{>}
\NormalTok{import matplotlib.pyplot as plt}
\NormalTok{plt.style.use('classic')}
\NormalTok{%matplotlib inline}
\NormalTok{import numpy as np}

\NormalTok{x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)}
\NormalTok{fig, ax = plt.subplots()}
\NormalTok{ax.plot(x, np.sin(x), '-b', label='Sine')}
\NormalTok{ax.plot(x, np.cos(x), '--r', label='Cosine')}
\NormalTok{ax.axis('equal')}
\NormalTok{leg = ax.legend();}
\KeywordTok{</script>}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{images/legend1.png} \textbf{Add a legend on different
position} If we want it on a specific position of the plot, we can use
loc=`upper left' inside the function to indicate where you want to put
the legend at.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{<!DOCTYPE }\NormalTok{html}\DataTypeTok{>}

\end{Shaded}

whether you need a box surrounding the legend or not.

\subsubsection{ggplot2 code template for data viz in
R}\label{ggplot2-code-template-for-data-viz-in-r}

({\textbf{???}})\\
This site includes full sets of R code to generate specific types of
graphs in ggplot2. Plots in ggplot2 are created by using ``layering''.
Layering combines a base plot with other aspects such as aesthetics,
titles, and labels using additional code. For those who favor Python for
data visualization, this layering approach in R is actually quite
similar to the syntax in Python's matplotlib library, in which
set\_style and specifying the axes labels and title are done separately
from the code that generates the plot itself.

To provide an example of the ``layering'' mentioned above, here is a
generic snippet of code for creating a scatterplot with ggplot2 and the
mtcars data set in R base, using this website's code as a template:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{data_viz_reader_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf}

The ggplot2 package allows R users to go beyond the simple and often
rudimentary-looking graphs in R and offers many ways of customizing data
visualizations. The layering technique also makes it easier to remember
the code to generate these plots, since geom functions for the layers
remain constant and they are all included in a single line of code.

Reproducible code for reference: This example demonstrates loading of
CSV data, which is then quantized into a diverging color scale. The
values are visualized as colored cells per day. Days are arranged into
columns by week, then grouped by month and years.

\subsection{Building Advanced Analytics Application with
TabPy}\label{building-advanced-analytics-application-with-tabpy}

(Beran \protect\hyperlink{ref-TabPy}{2017})\\
Imagine a scenario where we can just enter some x values in a dashboard
form, and the visualization would predict the y-variable! TabPy allows
us to integrate and visualize data from Python in Tableau.

The author here has given an example in which he tries to identify
criminal hotspots in the area using data from Seattle's police
department's 911 calls. The author uses machine learning (spatial
clustering) and creates a great interactive visualization which allows
viewers to click on the type of criminal activity to show various
clusters.

There are other examples and use cases that may be downloaded, and the
scripts are also given by the author to anyone who is interested in
replicating the visualizations.

\subsection{Creating a Diverging Bar
Chart}\label{creating-a-diverging-bar-chart}

({\textbf{???}})\\
A diverging bar chart shows and compares positive and negative values
for a particular variable. One popular use case is survey analysis, in
which multiple options are given as the categories, so each option has
one bar, and there are two opposite ends of the spectrum for the values.
These two sides are usually `positive' vs `negative', but they can also
be categorical values such as `agree' or `disagree'.

Below is the R code template one can use to create a diverging bar
chart.

\chapter{Ethics}\label{ethics}

Ethics refers to a set of moral principles that dictate a person's
behavior. While the field of ethics is often considered to be a
theoretical discipline, ethical conduct is an important objective in
practice as well. In the field of data visualization, there are many
opportunities to manipulate viewers with untruthful representations of
data; thus, like any other discipline, data visualization faces
significant ethical challenges, of which we will explore many in this
chapter.

\section{Importance of Ethics in
Visualization}\label{importance-of-ethics-in-visualization}

(Cairo \protect\hyperlink{ref-ethical_infographics}{2014})

Alberto Cairo sees data visualization as harmonization of journalism and
engineering. From these two disciplines, he takes the journalist ethos
of truth-telling and combines this with an engineering focus on efficacy
and efficiency. The result is a data visualization that contains
accurate and relevant information which is precisely and concisely
conveyed. Cairo explains that as a ``rule utilitarian,'' he believes it
is ``morally right'' to create graphics in this way. Here, it is useful
to review his blog post introducing the article. In short, the
responsibility of an ethical data visualizer is to create the most good
while doing the least harm. As such, conveying honest and relevant
information increases a person's understanding, and increased
understanding and knowledge positively correlates with personal
well-being.

Alberto Cairo addresses the ethical `why' of data visualization in this
article, while still grounding the discussion in a straightforward
analysis of harmful and helpful practices. He emphasizes that the
effectiveness of the display's communication of a message is as
important as the information itself. This makes intuitive sense because
useful information is rendered utterly useless if no one can understand
it.

\textbf{Again, since the moral purpose is to improve well-being through
understanding, a graphic that is confusing or misleading is unethical,
regardless of intent, since it creates misunderstanding for the
audience.} While it can be a bit jarring to think of a poorly designed
graphic as ``morally wrong,'' it is essential to think of the unintended
consequences that powerful yet misleading visuals may have on their
viewers.

\section{Implications of (Good/Bad) Data
Visualization}\label{implications-of-goodbad-data-visualization}

Raw data is often meaningless or at the very least is difficult to
derive immediate meaning from. When people face a broad set of
measurements and/or in large quantities, they are unable or unwilling to
spend the time required to process it. Technological advances of the
Digital Age contribute to an ever-growing pool of ``big data'' and have
dramatically improved our ability to collect such large amounts of
information. Thus, filtering, visualization, and interpretation of data
becomes increasingly important.

We should understand how to best derive meaning from data, but first we
should understand why its presentation in graphical format is so
powerful. Furthermore, while the ideal purpose of data visualization is
to facilitate understanding of data, visualization can also be used to
mislead. Some of the main methods of doing so are omitting baselines,
axis manipulation, omitting data, and ignoring graphing convention.
Examples of these methods will be explored later in this chapter.

\section{General Guidelines for Ethical
Visuals}\label{general-guidelines-for-ethical-visuals}

(Skau \protect\hyperlink{ref-ethics_code}{2012})

Data visualization is an up-and-coming field that currently does not
have many established regulations. This makes it easy to manipulate
readers without technically reporting false information. However,
certain standards should be followed in order to generate meaningful and
accurate visuals. The process can be broken down into three steps, each
with its own set of guiding rules.

\subsection{Data Collection}\label{data-collection}

The first step in any project is gathering the data. This is relatively
simple and does not offer much of an opportunity to introduce confusion.
The one thing to remember is to always get data from a reliable source.
The data provides the foundation for the entire project and must,
therefore, be trustworthy and verifiable. Furthermore, special care
should be taken for identification of inherent biases while using an
existing dataset or creating a new one. In addition, Cairo briefly
addresses four guidelines that are applicable in all information
gathering fields: 1. Beware of selection bias when choosing preexisting
datasets, validate the data, and include essential context. 2. False or
irrelevant information does not improve anyone's decision-making
capacity, so it cannot enhance well-being. 3. Even if the information is
both accurate and relevant, moral pitfalls may remain. 4. To avoid the
unethical trap of inscrutable or misleading graphics, Cairo exhorts us
to take an evidence-based approach when possible. The purpose of the
graphic dictates the form it takes; aesthetic preferences should never
override clarity.

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

This is the stage where the discoveries are made and thus, is the first
opportunity to manipulate the story. There is usually a lot of data
cleaning to do before creating a visual representation, but all data
wrangling steps should be deliberate and reasonable. If possible the
underlying code should be publicly shared so anyone can follow the
entire process. It is also important to explicitly state any assumptions
taken, though these ideally should be kept to a minimum. Here, it is
important to look at what the source data actually shows. It is the
ethical responsibility of presenters to perform careful analysis of the
data and extract true stories from them.

As the amount of data grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep
the insight derivation up to speed with the collection of data.
Therefore, data strategy becomes an imperative part of successfully
applying data to the business.

\subsection{Design}\label{design}

Once a visualizer decides on an argument, it is important to present it
honestly. While there is an inherent tradeoff between truthfulness of
the visualization and effectiveness of its argument, visualizers should
strive to maximize both. Deceptive techniques may be tempting to make a
stronger argument, but besides being ethically wrong, the intentional
use of deceptive visualization techniques will hurt the credibility of
the author and anyone else involved in the publication since an
experienced individual will know how to spot and disregard these
deceptions.

Visualization should not be used to intentionally hide or confuse the
truth. It should not seek to mislead the uninformed. Visualization has
great power, and as they say, with great power comes great
responsibility.

Guiding rules for designing the visuals according to Skau are as
follows: * Use the visuals you chose to depict the data and analysis
accurately. * Be attentive to labelling best practices and hierarchy of
importance of visual properties, such as colors. * Read on topics
related to visualization, study any visualizations critically, and be
open to criticism.

\section{Definitions of Data Deception and Graphic
Integrity}\label{definitions-of-data-deception-and-graphic-integrity}

({\textbf{???}}),({\textbf{???}})

Data visualization is a powerful communication tool to support arguments
with numbers in a way that is accessible and engaging. It is an
increasingly popular way to communicate and support arguments. More
people than ever before are making their own charts and infographics,
creating a unique problem. Despite the availability of great charting
resources and resources online to create and design amazing data
products, we are witnessing an influx of poorly-designed, misleading, or
downright deceptive data visualizations.

What does \textbf{data deception} mean? Data deception, defined by
School of Law at the New York University, is ``a graphical depiction of
information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may
create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies
from the actual message.'' Deceptive, misleading, or distorted graphs
are those that intentionally or unintentionally skew the data, and
result in a representation of incorrect conclusions.

Edward Tufte already introduced the concept of graphical integrity in
his book and presented six principles of graphic integrity. Here are the
principles of the book:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface
  of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the
  numerical quantities measured.
\item
  Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling should be used to defeat
  graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data
  on the graphic itself. Label important events in the data.
\item
  In time-series displays of money, deﬂated and standardized units of
  monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.
\item
  The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted
  should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data.
\item
  Show data variation, not design variation.
\item
  Graphics must not quote data out of context.
\end{itemize}

There are some ways in which distorted graphs can be created:\\

\section{Ethical Challenges in Data
Visualization}\label{ethical-challenges-in-data-visualization}

(Stempeck \protect\hyperlink{ref-dataviz_for_good}{2016})

Matt Stempeck's article recaps a brainstorming session concerning data
visualization ethics, and provides a fairly comprehensive list of
considerations for data visualizers to use as a guide to evaluate how
ethical their data products actually are. From replicability of a data
visualization, to persuasiveness and ambiguity in the data, this article
challenges data visualizers to assess how to ethically present data.

The discussion on perspective is an interesting one; it asks how data
visualizers might show different perspectives on the same data. Clearly
from the ``deceptive versions'' we have created for Vox's gun violence
article's visualizations, the same data can be used to show vastly
different perspectives, or make extremely contrasting claims. This may
counteract common opinion of data, since most people perhaps believe
there is an inherent truth to the data, but the data visualizer is in
control of what the audience sees; the person creating the visualization
cultivates a perspective to argue the claim. The data is at the heart of
this argument, but how the data visualizer presents it to the audience
may or may not include the whole story or the most truthful story.
Furthermore, while this challenge to show different perspectives
proposed by the article clearly should be undertaken by data visualizers
for the ethical good; when the goal of a data visualizer is to persuade
his/her audience to accept the visualizer's perspective, being fair and
thorough in considering the other side of the argument may contradict
the data visualizer's objective.

Of course, the challenge posed by the tug-of-war between ethics and
utility ( not to say that they are always contradictory in nature)
remains central in many sciences, including the data sciences, and it
makes the discussion of finding a balance between the two all the more
important.

\section{Data Visualization: A Tool for Social Change in
Cities}\label{data-visualization-a-tool-for-social-change-in-cities}

({\textbf{???}})

One field in which visualization can have a meaningful social impact is
promoting understanding of and generating discussions around cities.
With the development of a city, demographic changes, economic,
environmental and social problems become important issues. Visualization
plays an important role in promoting understanding of how the cities and
the societies within them work, debating the problems that cities face,
and engaging citizens to work toward their dream cities.

Recently, as part of Habitat III side event , LlactaLAB - Sustainable
Cities Research Group, presented a project called Live Infographics. It
was an interactive methodology that put citizens and experts opinions
about the New Urban Agenda on one platform to help generate a
`horizontal governance'. The different opinions were materialized with a
dynamic map to visualize the generated data. The primary objective of
the project is to generate citizen-led data collection and to enable
governments to build a better understanding of public sentiment, and
then engaging people in the process.

A great Urban Data Visualization ought to have the capacity to start
``Sociological Imagination''. It should provoke individuals to consider
how their individual choices, issues, struggles, and in general their
daily lives, are a extension of society, and how their choices
collectively influence public opinion.

As urban areas continue to develop, diverse and complex issues evolve
along with them. Disparity, isolation, loss of biodiversity and
environmental quality, etc. are all important but thorny issues, and
finding successful solutions will require uniting strategy producers,
academics, designers, and citizens. Visualization, if done right, can
help jumpstart important discussions between these diverse groups of
people and help solve the issues that emerge as the world becomes more
urbanized.

\section{Ethical Theory and Practice from Journalism and
Engineering}\label{ethical-theory-and-practice-from-journalism-and-engineering}

(Zinovyev \protect\hyperlink{ref-poli_social_science}{2011})

The fundamental objective of data visualization is to provide an
efficient graphical display for summarizing quantitative information and
supporting an argument. During the last decades, political science has
accumulated a large corpus of various kinds of data, and has gradually
evolved into a more scientific field, requiring the use of quantitative
information in analysis of relevant data.

Under U.S. law, research institutions receiving federal fundings must
consider ethical aspects of their research. Over time, researchers and
lawyers have established rules and practices for proper data collection
and utilization, with particular attention on human subject research.
Consent of the subjects to use their data, evaluation of any risk with
use or collection of data, and protecting the anonymity of data are some
of the rules that must be considered in ethical research methods.
However, these rules continue to evolve.

The ability to use data visualization to manipulate and mislead also
presents an issue. Research has found that even if viewers do not
originally support an idea, data presented in charts can persuade
viewers on the subject matter. Thus, many deceptive techniques can be
used to intentionally produce a dangerous visualization. Techniques such
as truncated axis (where the y-axis does not start at zero) or using the
area to represent a quantity (for instance comparing the size of two
adjacent circles) were found leading to wrong conclusions.

Misleading, incomprehensible, or incredible data visualization can
jeopardize people's trust, goodwill, or faith in research and advocacy
on vital human rights issues. There is no shortage of techniques for
deception through data visualization, and researchers have an ethical
responsibility to give a correct and faithful representation of data and
subjects.

\section{Misinformation Can be beautiful
too}\label{misinformation-can-be-beautiful-too}

(Harford \protect\hyperlink{ref-harford-misinformation}{2013})

Camouflage usually means blending in. That wasn't an option for the
submarine-dodging battleships of a century ago, which advertised their
presence against an ever-changing sea and sky with bow waves and
smokestacks. So, dazzle camouflage was born, an abstract riot of
squiggles and harlequin patterns. It wasn't hard to spot a dazzle ship
but the challenge for the periscope operator was to quickly judge a
ship's speed and direction before firing a torpedo on a ponderous
intercept. Dazzle camouflage was intended to provoke misjudgments, and
there are some evidence proving that it worked.

Now let's talk about data visualization, the latest fashion in numerate
journalism, albeit one that harks back to the likes of Florence
Nightingale. She was not only the most famous nurse in history but also
the creator of a beautiful visualization technique, the ``Coxcomb
diagram'', and the first woman to be elected as a member of the Royal
Statistical Society.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/aya-polar.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source: (Ayalasomayajula NA))

Data visualization creates powerful, elegant images from complex data.
It's like good prose: a pleasure to experience and a force for good in
the right hands, but also seductive and potentially deceptive. Because
we have less experience of data visualization than of rhetoric, we are
naive, and allow ourselves to be dazzled. Too much data visualization is
the statistical equivalent of dazzle camouflage: striking looks grab our
attention but either fail to convey useful information or actively
misdirect us.

For a relatively harmless example, consider The New Yorker's recent
online subway map of inequality. ``New York has a problem with
inequality,'' we are told. Then we are invited to click on different
subway maps to see a cross-sectional graph, showing us the peaks and
troughs of median income along different subway lines. The result is
gorgeous but far less informative than a map would have been. It is a
piece of art pretending to be a piece of statistical analysis.

A more famous example is David McCandless's unforgettable animation
``Debtris'', in which large blocks fall slowly against an eight-bit
soundtrack in homage to the addictive computer game Tetris. Their size
indicates their dollar value. ``\$60bn: estimated cost of Iraq war in
2003'' is followed by ``\$3000bn: estimated total cost of Iraq war'',
and then Walmart's revenue, the UN's budget, the cost of the financial
crisis, and much else.

The animation is pure dazzle camouflage. Statistical apples are compared
with statistical oranges throughout. The Iraq comparison, for instance,
is not one of ``then versus now'' as it first appears - but one of what
the US Department of Defense once thought it would spend versus a
broader estimate, including a financial value on the lives of dead
soldiers, and over a trillion dollars of ``macroeconomic costs''. The
war was a disaster- No need for a statistical bait-and-switch to make
that case.

Information can be beautiful, McCandless tells us. Unfortunately
misinformation can be beautiful too. Or, as statistical guru Michael
Blastland puts it, ``We are in danger of making the same statistical
mistakes that we've always made - only prettier.''

Those beautiful Coxcomb diagrams are no exception. They show the causes
of mortality in the Crimean war, and make a powerful case that better
hygiene saved lives. But Hugh Small, a biographer of Nightingale, argues
that she chose the Coxcomb diagram in order to make exactly this case. A
simple bar chart would have been clearer: too clear for Nightingale's
purposes, because it suggested that winter was as much of a killer as
poor hygiene was. Nightingale's presentation of data was masterful. It
was also designed not to inform but to persuade. When we look at modern
data visualizations, we should remember that.

\section{Visual Lies}\label{visual-lies}

(Bishop
\protect\hyperlink{ref-visual-lies}{2017}\protect\hyperlink{ref-visual-lies}{a})

This article focuses on a few methods that data visualizers utilize to
mislead users about research findings. For each method, the author has
highlighted the signifiers that are manipulated to promote an
unrealistic understanding of the visualized data. The author has
concentrated on examples of three areas to create deceptive data
visualization: size, segmentation, and graph type.

\subsection{Size}\label{size}

Size signifies quantity, volume or degree of variables within a data. In
the first figure, the y-axis from the graph to the right is cut when
transcribed onto the graph on the left. Here, both the graphs show the
same data but the one on the left represents the data in a misleading
fashion because of the way the axis is cut, and the result is that
interest rates have increased drastically from 2008 to 2012 -- a
misinterpretation that is avoided in the graph on the right.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Size1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Kwapien \protect\hyperlink{ref-misleading_data}{2015}))

\subsection{Quantity}\label{quantity}

Quantity measures size. When depicting points on a scatter plot, it is
helpful to manipulate the size of the points to represent differing
values of a variable that is not represented on the x and y axes. The
following graph shows quantity as two completely different measures. One
chart uses quantity as area and other uses it as radius. The result is
that the differences in quantity between points on such a scatter plot
would appear more dramatic than they should.

\end{figure}

(Source:(Bishop
\protect\hyperlink{ref-study_asks}{2017}\protect\hyperlink{ref-study_asks}{b}))

\subsection{Segmentation}\label{segmentation}

The figure below is an example of segmentation with a deceptive instance
of binning given in the legend on the left. Segmentation can be used to
show category, parts, domains or ranges within a chart. The author
states that correct use of segmentation can be a powerful tool to
enhance understanding, but can be deceptive if used incorrectly. This
example shows how binning can be misleading; in the left figure, binning
is not done appropriately, and it is therefore difficult to come up with
actual values of the data.

\includegraphics{images/Segmentation1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Bishop
\protect\hyperlink{ref-visual-lies}{2017}\protect\hyperlink{ref-visual-lies}{a}))

\subsection{Graph}\label{graph}

Two graphs that are often misrepresented are pie-charts and maps. In the
following figure, the author explains that pie-charts cannot be compared
accurately to one another. When striving for an accurate portrayal of
values, they should be avoided. The author further states that it would
be difficult to understand the pie-charts had the numbers not been
given. Pie charts should not be used in cases of too many vairables or
when the difference is not substantial between the vairables. Clubbing
of multiple variables into ``Others'' category is mostly used in Pie
Charts but ``Others'' category should not be one of the major pie in the
chart.

\includegraphics{images/PieCharts.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

(Source:(Bishop
\protect\hyperlink{ref-visual-lies}{2017}\protect\hyperlink{ref-visual-lies}{a}))

The author also asserts that when showing spatial data analysis, always
show population density when visualizing values that are
person-dependent. On a heat map where color signifies quantity, the
author suggests that a user will be drawn to the colors that a legend
indicates as most extreme.

In the following figure, areas that are darkest are simply the most
population-dense regions of the United States. Without accounting for
population density, the newly created map may look the same as hundreds
of maps bearing a striking resemblance to the figure, which are falsely
considered informative and are regularly shared across social media
sites.

The above pointers are helpful when analyzing a deceptive version of a
data product. However, data visualizers need to carefully draw the line
between creating misleading graphs that tell a different story and
developing deceptive versions that intend to exaggerate. This should be
applied in our projects and can also be used to enhance our
understanding of data visualization products.

Misleading graphs are sometimes deliberately misleading and sometimes,
it's just a case of people not understanding the data behind the graph
they create (Andalde \protect\hyperlink{ref-andale_2014}{2014}). But
some real-life misleading graphs go above and beyond the classic types.
Some are intended to mislead, others are intended to shock. The
``classic'' types of misleading graphs include cases such as:

\subsection{The Missing Baseline}\label{the-missing-baseline}

For example, the vertical scale is too big or too small, skips numbers,
or does not start at zero. For example, in the graph below, you might be
thinking that the graph on the right shows that The Times makes double
the sales of The Daily Telegraph. However, a closer look at the scale
reveals that although The Times does make more sales, it is only beating
the competition by about 10\%.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

(source:(Stephanie \protect\hyperlink{ref-missing_baseline}{2014}))
\#\#\# The Graph is not Labeled Properly\\
A graph may have the correct figures but still mislead its audience.
This one used a big headline that suggests to its audience that 5.3\% of
children get spinal cord injuries, which is a pretty scary statistic for
parents. But the real figure is about .0000003\% (based on 2000 injuries
per year out of a population of around 74,000,000). And for the figure 1
used in this article, ``Misleading Graphs: Displaying a Change in One
Variable Using Area or Volume'' (Robbins
\protect\hyperlink{ref-scaling_issues}{2012}), the label for the smaller
triangle in this graph says \$26.4 while the label for the larger
triangle says \$114.6. \$114.6 is 4.34 times \$26.4. It certainly looks
to me as if more than 4.34 smaller triangles will fit in the larger
triangle. It is the altitudes of the triangles that are proportional to
the numbers in the labels.

\subsection{Data is Left Out}\label{data-is-left-out}

Including only a part of the data is also an easy opportunity to
mislead. The following graph uses temperatures of only the first half of
the year to prove it was rising dramatically. For more examples and
inspirations on misleading or deceptive graphs refer the following
articles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bar charts without zero \& evenly spaced tick marks for uneven
  intervals: (Robbins \protect\hyperlink{ref-whats_wrong}{2011})
\item
  Graphs not drawn to scale:(Robbins
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-scaling_issues}{2012})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Treating Correlation as
Causation}\label{treating-correlation-as-causation}

Even if the labels and data in your graph are correct, the conclusion is
not necessarily logically correct. A correlation between X and Y does
not automatically indicate that the change in one variable is caused by
the change in the values of the other one, i.e.~correlation does not
imply causation. Viewers should bear in mind that such visuals only
present the correlation between ice cream sold and murders, not than
causation.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/harlin-ice-cream} \caption{A strange correlation between ice cream sales and murders (Source: [@harlin-coorelation])}\label{fig:harlin-ice-cream}
\end{figure}

Another trick for creating misleading graphs is an axis change: Changing
the y-axis maximum affects how the information in the graph is
perceived. A higher maximum will make the graph appear less volatile or
steep than a lower maximum. The axis can also be altered to deceive by
changing the ratio of a graph's dimensions, as demonstrated in the below
graphs.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Line_graph1.svg.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{images/175px-Line_graph1-3.svg.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/200px-Line_graph1-4.svg.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

While not technically wrong, improper extraction, tactic omitting data
or including only a certain chunk of data is certainly misleading. This
is more common in graphs that have time as one of their axes.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Bad_graph_extraction.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Visualizations should be simple and easy to understand, but at the same
time they should contain the essence of responsible visualization. To
make final results pure, ethical procedures need to be practiced
throughout all the steps of visualization.
\includegraphics{images/Good_graph_extraction.png}

In the data visualization terms, we call it truncated graph. A truncated
graph (also known as a torn graph) has a y-axis that does not start at
0. These graphs can create the impression of important change where
there is relatively little change.Truncated graphs are useful in
illustrating small differences.{[}16{]} Graphs may also be truncated to
save space. Commercial software such as MS Excel tend to truncate graphs
by default if the values are all within a narrow range. Truncating
graphs makes a small difference look like a huge one, thereby changing
the readers' judgement

An example of using good data in a misleading graph to fool readers
comes from Fox News. \includegraphics{images/1.png}

(Source:(``Data Mining Vs Data Visualization - Which One Is Better''
\protect\hyperlink{ref-datamining_vs_viz}{2018}))

The question of ethics in data visualization is not something that comes
to the fore when we start working. It is rarely the case that one sets
out to deceive without altering data. The topic of good ethics in data
visualization is very important and it is the duty of the creator to
take care of it.

At VisWeek2011, Jason Moore suggested a hippocratic oath for
visualization. It is intended to be succinct and easy to remember, while
still containing the essence of responsible visualization:

``I shall not use visualization to intentionally hide or confuse the
truth which it is intended to portray. I will respect the great power
visualization has in garnering wisdom and misleading the uninformed. I
accept this responsibility willfully and without reservation, and
promise to defend this oath against all enemies, both domestic and
foreign.''

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

As we conclude our brief survey of data visualization, it is clear that
the field is rich in potential applications in diverse disciplines, as
well as in practical and ethical complexities to be aware of. In the
previous chapters, we have presented some important theoretical and
practical principles to keep in mind when designing a data
visualization. We have also discussed and critiqued several examples of
data visualizations, learning common pitfalls and helpful tricks along
the way. As we have seen, developing an effective and ethical data
visualization is a complex process. The journey from raw data to
successful data visualization involves representing the data of
interest, processing the data to extract relevant information for the
desired argument, designing a mapping of this information to a visual
representation, rendering this representation, and combining all this
functionality in an easy-to-use product.

\section{The Future of Data
Visualization}\label{the-future-of-data-visualization}

Towler (\protect\hyperlink{ref-future_viz}{2015})

Data visualization is entering a new era. Emerging sources of
intelligence, theoretical developments and advances in multidimensional
imaging are reshaping the potential value that analytics and insights
can provide, with visualization playing a key role. The principles of
effective data visualization won't change. However, nextgen technologies
and evolving cognitive frameworks are opening new horizons, moving data
visualization from art to science.

Looking back, much attention has been given to the principles of
effective data visualization, such as substance, context and
actionability. As timeless tenets that will continue to be important,
regardless of medium or format, a brief review seems in order:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{As with any form of communication, effectively conveying a
  message with data requires that it be substantive.} And while creative
  visuals can enhance interest and memory, embellishment can't make up
  for lack of substance. According to purist Edward Tufte, ``Every
  single pixel should testify directly to content.''
\item
  \textbf{Visualization should be accurate and contextual.} David
  McCandless's Billion Dollar O'Gram provides an example of how greater
  meaning can be added by incorporating the bigger picture. According to
  McCandless, ``Absolute figures in a connected world don't give you the
  whole picture. They're not as true as they could be. We need relative
  figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller
  picture.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/BillionDollar.jpg}
\caption{Billion Dollar O'Gram}
\end{figure}

(Source: Towler (\protect\hyperlink{ref-future_viz}{2015}))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{More than anything else, data visualization should facilitate
  decision-making}, a goal that is difficult to achieve for many.
  According to a recent KPMG study, while data and analytics are deemed
  increasingly important to organizations, generating actionable
  insights remains a top challenge.
\end{itemize}

Looking forward, nextgen technologies and evolving cognitive frameworks
will boost the role that data visualization can play in organizations
and society. Consider the Internet of Things, Network and Complexity
Theories, and recent developments in multidimensional visualization:

The Internet has transformed the way we visualize information through a
better understanding of networks and an explosion in profile, behavioral
and attitudinal data. Sociograms, for example, have gone from relatively
simple graphs to multifaceted relational maps, as illustrated in the
following two charts, courtesy of the Journal of Social Structure and
the Leadership Learning Community.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/Pre-internet.jpg}
\caption{Figure 2:Pre-Internet sociogram}
\end{figure}

\centering
\includegraphics{images/InternetAge.jpg}
\caption{Figure 3:Internet-age sociogram}
\end{figure}

(Source: Towler (\protect\hyperlink{ref-future_viz}{2015}))

The Internet of Things is expected to have a similar impact, with
billions of connected devices capturing human and machine activity.
Fully capitalizing on the data generated will require further advances
in our ability to synthesize and display spatiotemporal activities.

Network Theory has been in use for decades, with its earliest
applications largely in social structure analysis. More recently,
Network Theory is being applied to understand relationships and
interactions in a variety of domains, such as crime prevention and
disease management. Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbling's work modeling the
spread of infectious diseases provides an example of the power that
Network Theory holds.

\section{Key Lessons Going Forward}\label{key-lessons-going-forward}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Don't try to be too cute.} Using all the fancy features of a
  visualization tool can lead to complex and confusing graphics. Just
  because you have a flashy hammer, it does not mean that everything is
  a nail. Don't lose your purpose in your infatuation with a new tool or
  feature. Stick to good design principles, and keep it simple (as was
  mentioned in the discussion about Patterns).
\item
  \textbf{Don't provide more data than you need to tell your story.}
  Humans have a tendency to want to create visualizations with
  multi-drill downs, filters, and tables. This is fine for ad hoc
  analysis, but if we are presenting a visual with a single story or
  argument, we must make sure every piece of data included plays a
  meaningful part in the story.
\item
  \textbf{Have more data to show what-ifs.} A great way to provide more
  information in a visualization is to use filters to provide what-if
  views. Having filters for different scenarios, options, and time
  slices provide the user a way to review and discover various
  perspectives on your data. Just make sure the user does not have to
  work too hard to get there and that they do not get lost in the data.
\item
  \textbf{Deliver value in your visualization.} Many graphs may be
  aesthetically pleasing or exciting but deliver no value. A graph with
  good value should deliver important insights to aid decision-making or
  prompt an action. Keep in mind, the main objective of a visualization
  is to deliver value, and each design decision should help achieve
  this.
\item
  \textbf{Understanding your audience is the most difficult and
  important part of developing a visualization.} Different audiences
  will feel differently about the same chart. So when we develop the
  argument from the data, we should keep our intended audience in mind.
\item
  \textbf{Share what you have found.} A visualization can be an
  effective influencer if used in the correct way and at the correct
  time.
\item
  \textbf{Think as author / reader} When designing graphs, try to stand
  at the reader side, to check whether the graph is making sense or if
  there is any misleading information being showcased. As a reader, one
  needs to detect if there is any visualization deception in the graph.
  Before making any conclusion, understanding details and information
  the graph is providing like legend, caption, numbers, etc. is
  important.
\item
  \textbf{Do Calculations} Accurate representation of data is necessary.
  Sometimes the original data cannot strongly support the main thesis.
  In that case, some extra calcuations based on the original dataset
  could make the idea more clear.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{It should be ethical Visualization}: Research has found that
even if viewers do not support an idea, data presented in charts can
persuade viewers on the subject matter. It means that visualization can
also be used to mislead either unintentionally or intentionally.
Misleading, incomprehensible, or incredible data visualization can
jeopardize people's trust, goodwill, or faith in research and advocacy
on vital human rights issues. So, certain standards should be followed
in order to generate meaningful, accurate and ethical visuals.

\textbf{Laying the groundwork for data visualization}

(SAS \protect\hyperlink{ref-why_dataviz_matters}{2014})\\
Before implementing new technology, there are some steps you need to
take. Not only do you need to have a solid grasp on your data, you also
need to \textbf{understand your goals, needs and audience.} Preparing
your organization for data visualization technology requires that you
first:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand the data you're trying to visualize, including its size and
  cardinality (the uniqueness of data values in a column).
\item
  Determine what you're trying to visualize and what kind of information
  you want to communicate.
\item
  Know your audience and understand how it processes visual information.
\item
  Use a visual that conveys the information in the best and simplest
  form for your audience.
\end{itemize}

Once you've answered those initial questions about the type of data you
have and the audience who'll be consuming the information, you need to
prepare for the amount of data you'll be working with. Big data brings
new challenges to visualization because large volumes, different
varieties and varying velocities must be taken into account. Plus, data
is often generated faster that it can be managed and analyzed.

\textbf{How Is It Being Used?}\\
(SAS \protect\hyperlink{ref-why_dataviz_matters}{2014})\\
Regardless of industry or size, all types of businesses are using data
visualization to help make sense of their data. Here's how.

\textbf{Comprehend information quickly}\\
By using graphical representations of business information, businesses
are able to see large amounts of data in clear, cohesive ways -- and
draw conclusions from that information. And since it's significantly
faster to analyze information in graphical format (as opposed to
analyzing information in spreadsheets), businesses can address problems
or answer questions in a more timely manner.

\textbf{Identify relationships and patterns}\\
Even extensive amounts of complicated data start to make sense when
presented graphically; businesses can recognize parameters that are
highly correlated. Some of the correlations will be obvious, but others
won't. Identifying those relationships helps organizations focus on
areas most likely to influence their most important goals.

\textbf{Pinpoint emerging trends}\\
Using data visualization to discover trends -- both in the business and
in the market -- can give businesses an edge over the competition, and
ultimately affect the bottom line. It's easy to spot outliers that
affect product quality or customer churn, and address issues before they
become bigger problems.

\textbf{Communicate the story to others}\\
Once a business has uncovered new insights from visual analytics, the
next step is to communicate those insights to others. Using charts,
graphs or other visually impactful representations of data is important
in this step because it's engaging and gets the message across quickly.

Visualizers}\label{additional-resources-for-aspiring-data-visualizers}

The field of data visualization is huge, and the capability of linking
storytelling and data-experience design is a commodity. An aspiring
visualizer seeking to further broaden his/her knowledge might find these
additional resources helpful.
