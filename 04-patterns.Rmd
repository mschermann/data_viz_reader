## Why pie chart is bad: a comparison with bar chart

Using pie chart is usually considered as a bad idea when it comes to data visualization. But why? Here, we explore some cons of using pie chart to convey information and compare its effectiveness to bar chart [@hickey-pie-worst] [@henry-defense-pie] [@quach-penny].

1. Some information may look nearly identical in pie chart. But if the data is presented with bar charts, the story is different.

2. It is difficult to compare the slices of a circle to figure out the distinctions in size between each pie slice, especially when there are a lot of categories.

3. Pie chart is easy to be manipulated (e.g. using a 3D pie chart).

4. Pie chart may be useful when comparing 2 different categories with different amounts of information. Specifically, it does a better job to distinguish two parts with a 25:75 split or one that is not 50:50 as people are sensitive to a right angle or a dividing line that is not straight. But this could be simply done by showing two numbers!

## Chose the right baseline in data visualization

Baseline is very important to data visualization. If baseline is different, the meanning will change a lot. Now here is a case study to show the importance of baseline and how to use it in different ways. 

Here I use the same method for a new dataset to .
```{r}
# Load the data.
setwd("/Users/boxiao/Desktop")
data<-read.csv("galaxy_sales.csv",header = TRUE)
data <- rbind(data[1:19,],c("Q4 '14",80),data[20:22,],c("da", 83))
data$year <- rep(c(2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015),each = 4)
data$qua <- seq(1:24)
data$Quarter <-NULL
```

1. Regular quaterly sales. We can see sales decreased a lot around 2014.  **The baseline here is historical sales.**
```{r}
# Regular time series for sales
par(cex.axis=0.7)
data.ts <- ts(data$sales, start=c(2010, 1), frequency=4)
plot(data.ts, xlab="", ylab="", main="sales per quater", las=1, bty="n")
```

2. Quaterly and yearly change sales. **The baseline here is zero and look at the percentage changes.**
```{r}
 # Quaterly change
curr <- as.numeric(data$sales[-1])
prev <- as.numeric(data$sales[1:(length(data$sales)-1)])
quaChange <- 100 * round( (curr-prev) / prev, 2 )
barCols <- sapply(quaChange, 
	function(x) { 
		if (x < 0) {
			return("#2cbd25")
		} else {
			return("gray")
		}
	})
#monChange.ts <- ts(monChange, start=c(1976, 2), frequency=12)
barplot(quaChange, border=NA, space=0, las=1, col=barCols, main="% change, quaterly")
```


```{r}
# Year-over-year change
curr <- as.numeric(data$sales[-(1:4)])
prev <- as.numeric(data$sales[1:(length(data$sales)-4)])
annChange <- 100 * round( (curr-prev) / prev, 2 )
barCols <- sapply(annChange, 
	function(x) { 
		if (x < 0) {
			return("#2cbd25")
		} else {
			return("gray")
		}
	})
barplot(annChange, border=NA, space=0, las=1, col=barCols, main="% change, annual")
```
From this plot, it is very clear that the magnitude of drops in sales for some quaters.

3. The sales difference compare to now. **The baseline here is the current sales.**
```{r}
# Relative to current 2015
curr <- as.numeric(data$sales[length(data$sales)])
salesDiff <- as.numeric(data$sales) - curr
barCols.diff <- sapply(salesDiff,
	function(x) {
		if (x < 0) {
			return("gray")
		} else {
			return("black")
		}
	}
)
barplot(salesDiff, border=NA, space=0, las=1, col=barCols.diff, main="Sales difference from last quater 2015")
```
4. Sales difference compared to the first quater. ** The baseline here is the first quater sales.**
```{r}
# Relative to first quater
ori <- as.numeric(data$sales[1])
salesDiff <- as.numeric(data$sales) - ori
barCols.diff <- sapply(salesDiff,
	function(x) {
		if (x < 0) {
			return("gray")
		} else {
			return("black")
		}
	}
)
barplot(salesDiff, border=NA, space=0, las=1, col=barCols.diff, main="Sales difference from first quater 2010")
```

5. The difference between quater sales and mean. ** The baseline is mean now.**
```{r}
# difference from the mean
mean <- mean(as.numeric(data$sales))
salesDiff <- as.numeric(data$sales) - mean
barCols.diff <- sapply(salesDiff,
	function(x) {
		if (x < 0) {
			return("gray")
		} else {
			return("black")
		}
	}
)
barplot(salesDiff, border=NA, space=0, las=1, col=barCols.diff, main="Sales difference from mean")
```


So before we start to plot, we should decide the baseline we want to use. Different baseline will lead to totally different graphs.
